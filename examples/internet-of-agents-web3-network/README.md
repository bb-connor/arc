# Internet Of Agents Web3 Network

Flagship local-realism example for Chio-mediated agent commerce over the Chio
web3 evidence stack.

This example keeps the service-order story from the original web3 bundle, but
promotes it into a four-organization topology where every default cross-org
API or tool boundary is mediated by Chio:

- Atlas Operator runs the treasury, procurement, settlement, and auditor agents.
- ProofWorks Provider runs the provider agent and provider review tool.
- CipherWorks Review Lab runs a specialist subcontractor agent behind its own
  trust-control authority and MCP edge.
- Meridian Federation Verifier evaluates passport, reputation, and federation
  admission evidence.

The scenario uses local services and local receipts by default. Base Sepolia
evidence is attached and verified when the live smoke report already exists, but
the example does not send chain transactions unless an operator separately runs
the deployment or smoke scripts. Mainnet remains blocked.

## Scenario

A treasury agent delegates a bounded web3 service budget. A procurement agent
runs a three-provider RFQ through a market broker protected by
`chio api protect`, rejects a cheap low-reputation provider and a malicious
over-budget provider, then selects ProofWorks through Chio policy over passport,
reputation, budget, runtime tier, and federation admission. ProofWorks
subcontracts a specialist proof-leaf review to CipherWorks through a narrowed
two-hop capability. A settlement agent routes the payment rail, assembles the
packet, maps it into a Chio web3 settlement dispatch, and an auditor verifies the
bundle through a read-only web3 evidence MCP edge.

The same run also exercises the control-plane surfaces that make this a Chio
example instead of a direct HTTP demo:

- `chio trust serve` issues root, delegated, provider, subcontractor,
  federation, and sidecar capabilities with runtime-attestation and SPIFFE
  workload identity evidence.
- `chio api protect` mediates the market broker and settlement desk OpenAPI
  services and emits sidecar receipts.
- `chio mcp serve-http` mediates the web3 evidence, provider review, and
  subcontractor review tools.
- Passport, challenge, presentation, reputation, federation policy, evidence
  export/import, and federated issuance artifacts are produced by `chio`
  CLI/trust-control calls and carry explicit source provenance in the bundle.
- Negative controls prove invalid SPIFFE identity, overspend, and velocity burst
  denials, each with a denial receipt.
- The default smoke also proves signed human approval, x402-style payment proof,
  cross-rail settlement routing, runtime trust degradation and re-attestation,
  receipt-correlated operations telemetry, historical reputation drift, and six
  adversarial denials.

## Running

First build the Chio CLI:

```bash
cargo build --bin chio
```

Then generate the local web3 validation ladder:

```bash
./scripts/qualify-web3-local.sh
```

Run the mediated example:

```bash
examples/internet-of-agents-web3-network/smoke.sh
```

To write into the standard qualification location:

```bash
examples/internet-of-agents-web3-network/smoke.sh \
  --artifact-dir target/web3-example-qualification/internet-of-agents-web3-network
```

If `target/web3-live-rollout/base-sepolia/base-sepolia-smoke.json` exists, the
smoke attaches it. To require that live evidence:

```bash
examples/internet-of-agents-web3-network/smoke.sh --require-base-sepolia-smoke
```

The release qualification wrapper runs the same example path:

```bash
./scripts/qualify-web3-examples.sh
```

### Evidence Console (Next.js UI)

The `app/` directory contains a Next.js 15 reviewer UI that renders the
artifact bundle. `smoke.sh` invokes its Playwright end-to-end suite against
the freshly generated bundle when `CHIO_RUN_E2E=1` is set (and skips it
otherwise). To run the full scenario plus the UI e2e locally:

```bash
CHIO_RUN_E2E=1 examples/internet-of-agents-web3-network/smoke.sh
```

The app can also be started standalone against any bundle directory:

```bash
cd examples/internet-of-agents-web3-network/app
bun install
bun run build
CHIO_BUNDLE_DIR="$(pwd)/tests/fixtures/good-bundle" bun run start
```

See `app/README.md` for the full bundle-schema contract and env vars.

The raw FastAPI services are implementation details. The scenario receives only
the Chio sidecar URLs for default execution, and the verifier fails if the
topology reports a direct unmediated default path.

## Artifact Contract

The smoke writes a reviewable bundle under the selected artifact directory:

review-result.json           verifier verdict
summary.json                 operator-facing pass/fail summary
```

`review-result.json` fails closed when required Chio artifacts are missing, any
default path is unmediated, a denial control does not deny, budget spend is not
reconciled, RFQ routing admits the wrong provider, two-hop subcontractor lineage
is missing, approval/payment/rail/dispute/runtime/observability checks fail, any
adversarial control allows, or a required Base Sepolia attachment is incomplete.

## What It Proves

- Recursive agent commerce can use x402-style payment requirements without
  treating x402 as the settlement source of truth.
- Procurement, provider execution, settlement, audit, and federation authority
  are separated and mediated by Chio capability tokens.
- API and MCP boundaries run through Chio sidecars or Chio MCP HTTP edges, not
  direct HTTP or stdin in the default path.
- Chio can route a provider market using trust, budget, runtime, federation, and
  reputation instead of acting only as an allow/deny wrapper.
- Two-hop subcontracting can inherit obligations and preserve receipt lineage.
- High-risk release requires a signed approval artifact before budget exposure
  and payment proof.
- Cross-rail settlement can choose Base Sepolia when evidence exists, fall back
  to local devnet otherwise, and deny unsupported Solana memo settlement in the
  same review bundle.
- Runtime degradation, quarantine, and re-attestation are reviewable artifacts.
- Operations telemetry correlates business events, Chio boundaries, and receipt
  identifiers.
- Prompt injection, invoice tampering, quote replay, expired capability reuse,
  unauthorized rail routing, and forged passport attempts all deny.
- Provider admission is tied to passport presentation, local reputation,
  federation policy, runtime appraisal, and SPIFFE workload identity artifacts.
- Budget exposure is authorized before quote acceptance and reconciled after
  settlement packet assembly.
- Behavioral baseline artifacts are produced from the Chio behavioral-feed
  model without overclaiming HushSpec runtime deny wiring.
- Optional Base Sepolia smoke evidence includes real tx hashes for operator
  setup, USDC approval, escrow create, root publication, release/refund paths,
  and price readback when the public testnet smoke report exists.
