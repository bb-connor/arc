//! Real SIGKILL-mid-append crash-recovery chaos test for the SQLite receipt
//! store.
//!
//! A separate victim process (`chaos_victim`) appends receipts, flushes the
//! store as a durability barrier, and only then records an `ack <seq>` line for
//! the receipt the store just promised was durable. This test SIGKILLs the
//! victim mid-loop, round after round against one reused store, then reopens the
//! store and proves that no acknowledged receipt was ever lost. The victim is
//! located through `CARGO_BIN_EXE_chaos_victim`; the test never shells out to
//! cargo.
