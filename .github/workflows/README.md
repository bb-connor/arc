# GitHub Actions workflows

## The PR build/lint/test gate lives in `ci.yml`

The required gate that catches workspace-wide compile breakage is the
`check` job ("Build, lint, test") in [`ci.yml`](./ci.yml). It runs on
`pull_request` and `push` to `main`, on the toolchain pinned by the
repo-root `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.93.0), with `Swatinem/rust-cache` for the
cargo registry/target cache. The four gate steps are:

| Gate | Step in `ci.yml` | Command |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Format | "Workspace format" | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` |
| Lint | "Workspace clippy" | `cargo clippy --workspace --lib --bins --examples -- -D warnings` |
| **Workspace build** | "Workspace build" | `cargo build --workspace` |
| Tests | "Workspace tests" + "Wasm guards library tests" | `cargo test --workspace --exclude chio-wasm-guards`, then `cargo test -p chio-wasm-guards --lib` |

The full set of required check contexts (the `name:` values GitHub branch
rulesets match on) is four jobs, not one:

- "Build, lint, test" (the `check` job, containing the four steps above)
- "MSRV build and test" (the `msrv` job; see below for its coverage caveats)
- "cargo-vet (locked supply-chain audit)" (the `cargo-vet` job)
- "cargo-deny (supply-chain bans/advisories/licenses)" (the `cargo-deny` job)

All four are required; cargo-vet and cargo-deny are not optional. The "Tokio
console smoke" check is *not* a separate required context: it is a step inside
the "Build, lint, test" job (see the test-lane section below), so it surfaces
under that job's context rather than as its own check.

The regression-test deletion guard and its scratch-repository self-test also
run inside "Build, lint, test". On pull requests, a deletion or rename from a
guarded regression path fails that required context unless a separate same-line
issue reference names each affected file.

## Formal PR smoke checks are present but not required

[`formal-pr-smoke.yml`](./formal-pr-smoke.yml) provides path-scoped feedback
without changing the four required contexts above. A lightweight scope job
classifies the PR diff before any proof toolchain is installed. The reported
verification check names are:

- "lean-build (lake + sorry scan + manifest cross-ref)"
- "kani-public-pr (lanes.pr sweep)"
- "kani-manifest-pr (non-core lanes.pr sweep)"
- "rust-verification-metadata (schema only, no proofs)"

The core Kani job reads all 24 PR harnesses from
`formal/rust-verification/kani-public-harnesses.toml`. The non-core job reads
the 12 matching entries for chio-attest-verify, chio-anchor, and chio-weights
from `.kani/harnesses.toml`. The metadata job validates registry structure only;
strict Creusot checks remain in `nightly.yml` and release qualification. These
checks are frozen in `releases.toml` and must not enter a ruleset until a
run-always aggregator exists. Real proof work must upload the configured
per-attempt execution marker; a successful no-op must not upload that marker.

The separate [`mutants.yml`](./mutants.yml) workflow also has a path-scoped PR
lane for six trust-boundary crates. It remains advisory until the evidence
ratchet in `releases.toml` activates blocking posture.

[`apalache-safety.yml`](./apalache-safety.yml) checks the distributed
revocation model at the PR bound, expands it on scheduled runs, reproduces the
registered negative witnesses, and runs the production ITF projection gate.
[`apalache-temporal.yml`](./apalache-temporal.yml) keeps both revocation
liveness properties scheduled and non-required, with a bounded selected-pair
refinement and an explicit fair-observation witness for the distributed
property. That property is conditional on weak-fair connected catch-up
opportunities and partition heal; its post-change flake rate is unmeasured, so
the lane remains frozen.

## Evidence-gated lane postures

`releases.toml` is the authoritative posture registry for pass/fail proof and
corpus lanes. Each entry records the workflow filename, exact job display name,
triggering event, evidence reset, freshness limit, required streak, and current
advisory or required posture. `scripts/lane-gate.sh` counts matching job results
from bounded GitHub Actions history. Whole-workflow conclusions and manual
dispatch runs do not count. Pull-request evidence must target the configured
base branch and include the exact per-attempt real-execution marker.

Strict proof artifacts are named with both `github.run_id` and
`github.run_attempt`. Streak evaluation reads the latest job attempt and rejects
a strict artifact left by any earlier attempt of the same run.

Scored lanes also upload a dedicated report-only artifact using the configured
prefix followed by `github.run_id` and `github.run_attempt`. The lane gate
requires one unexpired artifact and one JSON report with the configured schema,
checks the artifact digest, complete artifact listing, workflow commit and run
identity, rotation epoch, expected sample and inventory sizes, and exact
canonical inventory digest, normalized tool versions, registered sources,
files, and seeds. It recomputes global and source-scoped mutation counts and
activation ratios. Specification reports must include exact passing positive
baseline evidence for every registered model. Proof reports must also meet the
configured global and per-file viability floor. A missing, duplicate, stale,
weaker, replayed, or
internally inconsistent report cannot contribute to the promotion streak.

Strict report generation requires a clean worktree and executes the manifest
gate set. The report checker validates schema, hashes, source bindings, commit
identity, and the recorded evidence boundary. It does not replay proof commands;
the protected generator process attests those gate statuses.

The registry covers seven scheduled formal lanes, all four formal PR checks
listed above, and both locked-corpus smoke checks. The scored specification and
proof mutation lanes remain advisory until their configured evidence streaks
qualify them for promotion.

- "fuzz-corpus-smoke-pr (locked replay)"
- "fuzz corpus smoke"

All thirteen entries are advisory, and no hosted qualifying streak is claimed by
the registry. Required promotion follows the runbook in
`docs/formal/ROADMAP.md` and adds structured `promotion_evidence` to the same
protected registry edit. Pull-request checks remain frozen until they use a
run-always aggregator and real-execution marker. Scheduled-only required lanes
gate release qualification via
`scripts/lane-gate.sh --fleet`; they are never added as pull-request contexts.
The separately judged cargo-mutants catch-ratio gate remains under
`scripts/mutants-gate.sh`.

### Why the build step MUST stay `--workspace`, not per-crate (`-p`)

A downstream-exhaustiveness break is a class of break a per-crate scoped gate misses: a new enum
variant compiles fine in its own crate but breaks an exhaustive `match` in a
*downstream* crate. A `-p <crate>` build only compiles that crate's tree, so
cross-crate breakage slips through; `cargo build --workspace` compiles every
member's `src/`, so the downstream non-exhaustive `match` fails the build.

Note this step does not pass `--all-features`, so it only compiles
default-feature source. Modules behind non-default features are not compiled
(for example provider-adapter-gated modules in
`crates/protocol/chio-openai-adapter/src/lib.rs`), so a downstream-exhaustiveness break that
lives behind an optional feature can still slip through this lane. Full
coverage of feature-gated source would require a separate all-feature build
lane.

Do not narrow the "Workspace build" step to `-p`/path-scoped invocations, and
do not delete it in favor of relying on clippy alone (clippy here is scoped to
`--lib --bins --examples` and likewise does not compile test/bench targets).
Keeping the unscoped `cargo build --workspace` step is the invariant that
closes the downstream-exhaustiveness gap.

### The test lane: workspace-wide except a separate wasm-guards lib lane

The tests run in two steps, not one, and they do *not* uniformly cover
integration-test targets:

- "Workspace tests" runs `cargo test --workspace --exclude chio-wasm-guards`.
  The job installs Bun 1.3.3 first because the anchored-root tamper tests run
  required Rust-TypeScript differentials and fail when Bun is unavailable.
  Across every other workspace member this compiles and runs `#[cfg(test)]`
  unit tests *and* the `tests/` integration targets, extending the
  build-breakage guarantee above to test code. Note this lane does not pass
  `--all-features`/`--features`, so it only exercises default-feature code:
  Cargo skips any `[[test]]` target whose `required-features` are not selected.
  For example `crates/kernel/chio-kernel` gates the `hybrid_receipt_sign`,
  `compliance_certificate_hybrid`, and `canonical_bytes_hybrid` integration
  targets behind the `pq` feature, and no PR lane selects `pq`, so those targets
  are not compiled or run by any gate. (The one feature-gated integration target
  that *is* covered is `tokio_console_smoke`: the separate "Tokio console smoke"
  step in `ci.yml` runs `cargo test -p chio-kernel --features tokio-console-smoke
  --test tokio_console_smoke`.) `chio-wasm-guards` is excluded here because its
  `tests/` integration suite needs a wasm-capable harness and cannot run in this
  plain `cargo test` lane.
- "Wasm guards library tests" then runs `cargo test -p chio-wasm-guards --lib`.
  `--lib` is "test only this package's library", so this lane compiles and runs
  only `chio-wasm-guards`'s in-crate unit tests. The many integration targets
  under `crates/guards/chio-wasm-guards/tests/` are **not** compiled or run by
  this gate.

So the wasm-guards carveout is deliberate but partial: the crate's library code
is gated by the PR lane, while its `tests/` integration targets are **not
exercised by any PR gate**. No PR gate compiles or runs
`crates/guards/chio-wasm-guards/tests/*` (the other PR-triggered wasm/conformance
workflows build browser SDK artifacts, run conformance peers, or run benches
via `cargo bench`, none of which invoke these integration targets). They are
covered outside the PR gates instead: the push-to-`main` and manual
`release-qualification.yml` workflow has a separate "Release MSRV
full-workspace test" job that runs `cargo test --workspace` with no `--exclude`,
which does compile and run those `wasmtime-runtime` integration targets. The
artifact-producing job waits for successful exact-head CI and runs only
release-specific gates, so the two long lanes have independent hosted-job time
budgets. Editing or adding a test under
`crates/guards/chio-wasm-guards/tests/` will not be caught by any PR gate (only
later, by Release Qualification on push/main or a manual run). Do not "fix" the
PR-gate carveout by folding
`chio-wasm-guards` back into the PR `--workspace` test step (it is excluded there
on purpose), and do not assume a green PR `ci.yml` run covered the wasm-guards
integration tests.

The artifact-producing job records both `exact-ci-run-id.txt` and
`exact-ci-run-attempt.txt`. Together they identify the successful CI execution
that qualification observed, including reruns of the same workflow run. CI
cancels superseded same-ref executions so the newest `main` candidate is not
queued behind an older full-workspace run.
Manual exact-SHA CI dispatches use `Exact-SHA ...` check names, distinct from
the four branch-protection contexts, so raw-head qualification cannot satisfy
required checks for a pull request merge ref.
For `main`, Release Qualification accepts only the exact-SHA push CI run (or a
rerun attempt of that run). A manual CI dispatch cannot replace a failed push
range check. Manual exact-SHA dispatch remains available for branch and tag
qualification.

### The MSRV job does not fully test the workspace

The "MSRV build and test" job (`msrv` in `ci.yml`) runs `cargo build
--workspace` on the pinned MSRV toolchain, but its test command does **not**
cover the whole workspace. It runs:

```
cargo test --workspace --exclude chio-conformance --exclude chio-wasm-guards --exclude chio-formal-diff-tests
cargo test -p chio-formal-diff-tests --no-run
cargo test -p chio-wasm-guards --lib
```

So MSRV test coverage is uneven:

- `chio-conformance` is **not tested on MSRV** at all (excluded from the
  workspace test run and never re-added).
- `chio-formal-diff-tests` gets only `--no-run`: its tests are compiled on MSRV
  but not executed.
- `chio-wasm-guards` gets only `--lib`: its in-crate unit tests run on MSRV, but
  its `tests/` integration targets do not.

Do not describe the MSRV job as testing the full workspace; it builds the full
workspace and tests it with the carveouts above.

> Note (firmware/console): the Chio workspace is Rust-only; the firmware and
> console build pipelines referenced by the PR build/lint/test gate live in their own repos and
> are out of scope for this workflow.

## The `chio-pheromone-*` gate family is kept as separate files

The 15 `chio-pheromone-*.yml` workflows look like near-duplicates but must not be
consolidated into a single matrix workflow. Two constraints rule out the obvious
collapses.

### The 15 files

Relay subsystem gates (each runs one `scripts/check-<name>.sh`):

- `chio-pheromone-relay.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-ops.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-observability.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-routing.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-delivery.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-handoff.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-assurance.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-assurance-archive.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-assurance-archive-package.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-assurance-archive-hardening.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-assurance-export.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-relay-alert-assurance-external-retention.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-directory-lifecycle.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-runtime.yml`
- `chio-pheromone-transit.yml`

### A single matrix workflow cannot path-scope per gate

Each file carries its own `on.paths` trigger (a different set of crate, spec,
script, and doc globs). A single matrix workflow has one `on:` block and cannot
express per-matrix-entry path filters, so collapsing them forces every gate to
run on every pheromone-related change, defeating the path-scoping these files
provide.

### The reusable-workflow (`workflow_call`) pattern does not fit either

Extracting the shared job body into one `workflow_call` reusable workflow with
thin path-triggered callers fails because the job bodies are not uniform. They
fall into four distinct shapes:

| Shape | Files | `permissions:` block | `Swatinem/rust-cache` | `setup-node` | node version |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A | relay, relay-ops, directory-lifecycle, runtime, transit | none | no | no | - |
| B | relay-observability | none | no | yes | 22 |
| C | alert-routing, alert-delivery, alert-handoff, alert-assurance | `contents: read` | yes | yes | 24 |
| D | the five `...-assurance-archive` / `-export` / `-external-retention` | `contents: read` | yes | no | - |

`workflow_call` inputs could express these differences (booleans gating the
cache / node steps via `if:`, a string for the node version, strings for the
gate name and script path), but four constraints block the conversion, each on
its own sufficient:

1. The four shapes require conditional (`if: inputs.*`) steps. The resulting
   single file is harder to reason about than the 15 flat files it replaces.
2. Permissions posture differs. Shapes A and B set no `permissions:` block (they
   inherit the repository / org default token scope); shapes C and D pin
   `contents: read`. Under `workflow_call`, the effective token scope is governed
   by the called workflow plus the caller job's `permissions:`. Folding files
   with different permission postures into one reusable workflow risks silently
   changing the token scope for some gates, over-granting a fail-closed CI
   surface.
3. The node-version split (22 in shape B vs 24 in shape C) is not reconcilable
   from the YAML alone; collapsing to one version would change at least one
   gate's node runtime.
4. Required status-check matching. Branch-protection / ruleset config lives in
   GitHub settings outside this repo. Converting these to callers changes how
   each check surfaces (it appears as `caller / reusable-job` instead of the
   current top-level job name), which can silently break a required-check rule.

Any consolidation must be validated on a branch where GitHub Actions runs, with
Actions executing, against four invariants: the per-file `on.paths` triggers
still gate correctly on both `pull_request` and `push`; the effective token
permissions per gate are unchanged; the node version choice is deliberate; and
the surfaced check names still satisfy the required-status-check rules
configured in GitHub settings.
