"""Handler-level decorator that evaluates via the Chio Lambda Extension.

The :func:`chio_tool` decorator wraps a Lambda handler (or any Python callable)
so that every invocation first asks the extension at
``http://127.0.0.1:9090/v1/evaluate`` whether the call is allowed. If the
extension denies it, or is unreachable, the wrapped function is NOT called
and an :class:`ChioLambdaError` is raised -- this is the fail-closed contract.

Capability identifiers and request arguments are resolved at call time:

* ``capability_id`` can be supplied explicitly on each call, taken from the
  environment variable named by ``capability_env`` (default
  ``CHIO_CAPABILITY_ID``), or picked out of the event payload at
  ``capability_event_key``.
* ``arguments_extractor`` lets callers shape what the extension sees. By
  default the whole event dict is forwarded.

The decorator injects the resolved ``capability_id`` and ``verdict`` kwargs
into the wrapped function if it declares them in its signature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scope:
        Capability scope name passed to the extension (e.g. ``"db:read"``).
    tool_server:
        Tool server identifier recorded on the receipt.
    tool_name:
        Tool name recorded on the receipt.
    client:
        Optional custom :class:`ChioLambdaClient`. The default is lazily
        constructed on first use and reused for the lifetime of the
        Lambda execution environment (warm-starts share it).
    capability_env:
        Name of the environment variable used as the fallback source for
        ``capability_id``.
    capability_event_key:
        Key in the Lambda ``event`` dict that carries the capability id if
        not passed explicitly.
    arguments_extractor:
        Function that receives the event and returns the dict to forward to
        the extension as ``arguments``. Default: the whole event if it is a
        mapping, else ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        Decorator. The wrapped function is only executed when the extension
        returns ``decision == "allow"``.
