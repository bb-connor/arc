/**

 *
 * Conformance test utilities for the Chio TypeScript SDK.
 * Verifies that TS SDK behavior matches the Rust kernel.
 *
 * The schema-derived companion types live under `./_generated/index.ts` and
 * are regenerated via `cargo xtask codegen --lang ts`. They are exposed
 * here as the `Schemas` namespace tree so consumers can write
 * `Schemas.JsonRPC_Request.ChioJSONRPC20Request` without importing the
 * generated module directly. The hand-written canonical-JSON encoder and
 * the receipt verifier remain authoritative for behavior; the generated
 * types describe shape only.
