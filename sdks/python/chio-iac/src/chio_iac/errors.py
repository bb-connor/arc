"""Error types raised by the Chio IaC integration.

The IaC wrapper surfaces three error classes:

* :class:`ChioIACError` -- an Chio-governed IaC operation (``terraform plan``,
  ``terraform apply``, a Pulumi program run, or a plan-review check) was
  denied or failed by the Chio sidecar. Carries the structured verdict so
  tooling can inspect the guard that denied and the reason.
* :class:`ChioIACConfigError` -- the IaC wrapper's configuration is invalid
  (missing ``capability_id``, missing binary, mismatched scope, etc.).
  Raised before any sidecar evaluation takes place.
* :class:`ChioIACPlanReviewError` -- the plan-review guard found
  out-of-scope resource types in a Terraform / Pulumi plan. Raised before
  ``terraform apply`` dispatches so the apply never touches the cloud.
