# chio-py Architecture Note

## Boundaries

- `src/chio/__init__.py` is the public Python SDK facade for hosted sessions,
  auth, receipt queries, nested callback helpers, and errors.
- `src/chio/invariants/` owns low-level cross-language compatibility checks
  for canonical JSON, hashing, signing, capabilities, receipts, and manifests.
- `src/chio/invariants/manifest.py` owns signed manifest parsing, canonical
  signing-body generation, Ed25519 signature verification, and the Python
  `structure_valid` result.
- `tests/test_manifest.py` is the local manifest compatibility harness.

## Manifest Structure Admission

`_validate_manifest_structure` mirrors Rust `chio-manifest::validate_manifest`
so a Python caller reports the same `structure_valid` verdict as Rust admission
and FFI paths. The shared rules:

- Identity fields `server_id`, `name`, and `version` must be non-blank and
  unpadded.
- Tool names must be non-blank, unpadded, and unique; `input_schema` and, when
  present, `output_schema` must be JSON objects.
- `required_permissions` is optional. When present, `read_paths`, `write_paths`,
  `network_hosts`, and `environment_variables` must be arrays of non-blank,
  unpadded, non-duplicate strings, and no unknown permission fields are allowed.

## Security And API Constraints

- The public `verify_signed_manifest` and `verify_signed_manifest_json` return
  shape is stable.
- Canonical JSON byte generation and signature verification are independent
  from structural validity.
- Any structural divergence from the Rust rules is fail-closed
  `structure_valid: false`.

## MCP execution evidence

`src/chio/mcp.py` wraps an application-owned official MCP client session. It uses
existing canonical JSON and receipt verification primitives to check the pinned
kernel signer, mediated decision, invocation identity, exact arguments, and output
hash. The envelope carries the kernel output before MCP display projection, and
the wrapper returns only this committed value. It does not execute a local callback
after verification or retry an uncertain effect. Its public result retains the
receipt and output for application audit, including verified denials. Tests in
`tests/test_mcp.py` exercise tampering, request replay, key pinning, caller mutation,
and transport failure without retries. The optional MCP dependency is needed only
when an application creates the official client session.
