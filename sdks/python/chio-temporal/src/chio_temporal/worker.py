"""Convenience builder for an Chio-governed Temporal worker.

:func:`build_chio_worker` wires the standard pieces together:

* An :class:`chio_temporal.ChioActivityInterceptor` mounted on the
  Temporal :class:`temporalio.worker.Worker`'s ``interceptors`` list.
* A :class:`chio_temporal.WorkflowGrant` minted from
  ``capability_id`` / ``workflow_id`` and pre-registered on the
  interceptor.

The function returns ``(worker, interceptor, grant)`` so callers retain
handles to the interceptor (for per-run :class:`WorkflowReceipt`
inspection) and the grant (for attenuation).

For tests and offline usage, the returned ``interceptor`` is the same
one installed on the worker, so you can rebind its Chio client to a
:class:`chio_sdk.testing.MockChioClient` after construction if needed.

    """Build a Temporal worker with the Chio interceptor + grant wired in.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client:
        A connected :class:`temporalio.client.Client`.
    task_queue:
        Temporal task queue the worker polls.
    activities:
        Activity callables to register.
    workflows:
        Workflow classes to register. Optional; activity-only workers
        are valid.
    capability_id:
        Pre-existing capability token id. When ``scope`` is also
        supplied, the builder mints a fresh capability via the supplied
        ``chio_client`` and uses its id instead; ``capability_id`` then
        acts as a label on the grant metadata for audit correlation.
    workflow_id:
        Temporal workflow identifier the grant is scoped to.
    chio_client:
        :class:`chio_sdk.ChioClient` (or mock) used to mint the capability
        token and evaluate activity calls. The interceptor reuses this
        client; callers own its lifecycle.
    scope:
        Optional :class:`ChioScope`. When provided, the builder mints a
        new capability token via ``chio_client.create_capability`` and
        uses that token. When ``None``, the caller must have already
        minted the token externally and is responsible for passing its
        id (the builder then constructs a synthetic stand-in token with
        an empty scope so the grant envelope still serialises).
    subject:
        Hex-encoded Ed25519 public key bound to the minted capability.
        Required when ``scope`` is provided; ignored otherwise.
    tool_server:
        Default Chio tool server id for activities that do not appear in
        ``activity_tool_server_map``. Can be overridden per-activity.
    default_tool_server:
        Fallback when neither the grant nor the map resolve a server.
        Takes effect only when ``tool_server`` is empty.
    activity_tool_server_map:
        Optional mapping from activity type to Chio tool server id. See
        :class:`ChioActivityInterceptor`.
    sidecar_url:
        Sidecar base URL. Only used when ``chio_client`` is ``None`` in
        the interceptor chain; the builder always passes ``chio_client``
        so this is a pass-through for completeness.
    ttl_seconds:
        Lifetime of the minted capability token when ``scope`` is set.
    interceptors:
        Extra :class:`temporalio.worker.Interceptor` instances to chain
        after the Chio interceptor.
    receipt_sink:
        Optional callable invoked with each finalised workflow receipt
        envelope. See :class:`ChioActivityInterceptor.receipt_sink`.
    worker_kwargs:
        Forwarded to :class:`temporalio.worker.Worker`.

    Returns
    -------
    (worker, interceptor, grant):
        ``worker`` is the configured :class:`temporalio.worker.Worker`;
        ``interceptor`` is the :class:`ChioActivityInterceptor` mounted
        on it; ``grant`` is the :class:`WorkflowGrant` registered for
        ``workflow_id``.
