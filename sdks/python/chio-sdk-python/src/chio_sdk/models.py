# Public Pydantic v2 surface for chio-sdk-python.
#
# This module re-exports the legacy hand-typed surface from
# ``chio_sdk.models_legacy`` so the 17 framework adapters under sdks/python/*
# (which import from ``chio_sdk.models``) keep working unchanged while the
# generated Pydantic bindings under ``chio_sdk._generated`` settle. The
# generated module is also re-exported as ``chio_sdk.models.generated`` so
# new consumers can opt in to the schema-derived types directly.
#
# Lifecycle (M01.P3.T2 -> M01+1):
#   * Today: ``models.py`` re-exports the hand-typed legacy classes
#     (verbatim, with their ``classmethod`` factory helpers and subset
#     algebra preserved).
#   * After M01+1: callers migrate to ``chio_sdk._generated`` and the legacy
#     module is deleted. The header on every ``_generated/*.py`` file makes
#     the regeneration entry point obvious; ``models_legacy.py`` carries a
#     matching deprecation banner.
#
# House rules: no em dashes (U+2014); use `-` or parentheses.
"""Typed Python models mirroring Chio core Rust types.

Compatibility shim re-exporting from :mod:`chio_sdk.models_legacy`. The
generated Pydantic-v2 modules under :mod:`chio_sdk._generated` are
authoritative for wire shape; this module preserves the convenience surface
(classmethods, subset checks) until adapter call-sites migrate.
