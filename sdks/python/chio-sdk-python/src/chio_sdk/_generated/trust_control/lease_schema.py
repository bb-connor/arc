class ChioTrustControlAuthorityLease(BaseModel):
    """
    One operator-visible authority lease projection emitted by the trust-control service over `/v1/internal/cluster/status` and the budget-write authority block. A lease names the leader URL that currently holds the trust-control authority, the cluster election term that minted it, the lease identifier and epoch that scope subsequent budget and revocation writes, and the unix-second expiry plus configured TTL that bound the lease's continued validity. Mirrors the `ClusterAuthorityLeaseView` serde shape in `crates/chio-cli/src/trust_control/service_types.rs` (lines 1837-1848). The view uses `serde(rename_all = camelCase)` so wire field names are camelCase. The shape is constructed in `crates/chio-cli/src/trust_control/cluster_and_reports.rs` (`cluster_authority_lease_view_locked`, lines 841-862) from the live cluster consensus view; `leaseValid` is true only when the cluster has quorum and `leaseExpiresAt` is still in the future. NOTE: `leaseExpiresAt` and `termStartedAt` are unix **seconds** (computed in `cluster_and_reports.rs` lines 1580-1606 as `unix_timestamp_now() + lease_ttl_ms / 1000`), even though `leaseTtlMs` itself is in milliseconds. The asymmetry mirrors the live runtime shape and is preserved on the wire so consumers do not have to re-scale by 1000.
