class ChioTrustControlAuthorityLease(BaseModel):
    """
    One operator-visible authority lease projection emitted by the trust-control service over `/v1/internal/cluster/status` and the budget-write authority block. A lease names the leader URL that currently holds the trust-control authority, the cluster election term that minted it, the lease identifier and epoch that scope subsequent budget and revocation writes, and the unix-second expiry plus configured TTL that bound the lease's continued validity. Wire field names are camelCase. `leaseValid` is true only when the cluster has quorum and `leaseExpiresAt` is still in the future. NOTE: `leaseExpiresAt` and `termStartedAt` are unix seconds (`unix_timestamp_now() + leaseTtlMs / 1000`), even though `leaseTtlMs` itself is in milliseconds. The asymmetry mirrors the live runtime shape and is preserved on the wire so consumers do not have to re-scale by 1000.
