class ChioTrustControlLeaseHeartbeat(BaseModel):
    """
    One trust-control heartbeat used to refresh a held authority lease before it expires. The heartbeat names the lease being refreshed (`leaseId` plus `leaseEpoch`), the leader URL claiming continued ownership, and the unix-millisecond observation timestamp at which the heartbeat was issued. Drafted from `spec/PROTOCOL.md` section 9 prose around `/v1/internal/cluster/status` and the cluster lease lifecycle described in `crates/chio-cli/src/trust_control/cluster_and_reports.rs` (lines 832-877). NOTE: this schema is drafted from prose plus the `ClusterAuthorityLeaseView` shape; there is no dedicated `LeaseHeartbeatRequest` Rust struct in the live trust-control surface yet, so wire field names follow the same `serde(rename_all = camelCase)` convention used by the lease projection. The dedicated request/response struct is expected to land alongside the cluster RPC formalization in M09 P3.
