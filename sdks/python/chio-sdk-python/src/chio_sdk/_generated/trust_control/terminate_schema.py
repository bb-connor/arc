class ChioTrustControlLeaseTermination(BaseModel):
    """
    One trust-control termination request that voluntarily releases a held authority lease before its TTL expires. Termination names the lease being released (`leaseId` plus `leaseEpoch`), the leader URL releasing it, and a typed `reason` so operators can distinguish leader handoff from quorum loss or operator-initiated stepdown. Drafted from `spec/PROTOCOL.md` section 9 prose plus the lease invalidation paths in `crates/chio-cli/src/trust_control/cluster_and_reports.rs` (lines 1595-1611) where loss of quorum or a leader change clears `lease_expires_at` and bumps the election term. NOTE: this schema is drafted from prose; there is no dedicated `LeaseTerminateRequest` Rust struct in the live trust-control surface yet. The dedicated request/response struct is expected to land alongside the cluster RPC formalization in M09 P3. Wire field names follow the `serde(rename_all = camelCase)` convention used by the sibling lease projection so the families stay consistent on the wire.
