class ChioReceiptMerkleInclusionProof(BaseModel):
    """
    Merkle inclusion proof for a single receipt leaf in a receipt-log Merkle tree. Mirrors the serde shape of `MerkleProof` in `crates/chio-core-types/src/merkle.rs`. The proof allows an auditor, holding only the published Merkle root and the original leaf bytes, to verify that the leaf was included in a tree of the given size at the given position. The audit path is the ordered list of sibling hashes encountered when walking from the leaf up to the root; siblings whose subtree was carried upward without pairing (the right-edge of an unbalanced level) are omitted. M04 deterministic-replay consumes this schema as the contract for golden-bundle inclusion artifacts under `tests/replay/goldens/<family>/<name>/`.
