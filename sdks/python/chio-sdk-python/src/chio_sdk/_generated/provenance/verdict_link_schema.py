Verdict-specific required fields are enforced via `oneOf` so the wire shape stays in lock-step with the HTTP verdict union in `spec/schemas/chio-http/v1/verdict.schema.json`: `deny` requires both `reason` and `guard`; `cancel` and `incomplete` require `reason`; `allow` rejects either. The verdict vocabulary mirrors the HTTP verdict tagged union and the per-step verdict family `StepVerdictKind` in `crates/chio-core-types/src/plan.rs` (lines 110-138). NOTE: there is no live `VerdictLink` Rust struct on this branch; the link is drafted as the wire form of the verdict-to-provenance edge that M07's tool-call fabric and the M01 receipt-record schema reference indirectly today. The dedicated Rust struct is expected to land alongside the M07 phase that wires the tool-call fabric to the provenance graph and the schema will be re-pinned to that serde shape at that time.
