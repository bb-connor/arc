class ChioProvenanceCallChainContext(BaseModel):
    """
    One delegated call-chain context bound into a governed Chio request. The context names the stable `chainId` that identifies the delegated transaction, the upstream `parentRequestId` inside the trusted domain, the optional `parentReceiptId` when the upstream parent receipt is already available, the root `originSubject` that started the chain, and the immediate `delegatorSubject` that handed control to the current subject. Chio binds this shape into governed transactions and promotes it through the provenance evidence classes (`asserted`, `observed`, `verified`) defined in `crates/chio-core-types/src/capability.rs` (`GovernedProvenanceEvidenceClass`, lines 1303-1314). Mirrors the `GovernedCallChainContext` struct in `crates/chio-core-types/src/capability.rs` (lines 952-967). The struct uses `serde(rename_all = camelCase)` so wire field names are camelCase.
