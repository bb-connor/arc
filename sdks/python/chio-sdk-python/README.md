# chio-sdk-python

Python SDK for the [Chio protocol](../../../spec/PROTOCOL.md). A thin,
async HTTP client to the Chio sidecar kernel, plus the typed models for
capabilities, scopes, verdicts, and receipts that the higher-level
framework integrations (FastAPI, Django, LangChain, and others) build on.

The sidecar runs as a local process exposing a localhost HTTP API. This
package never signs or evaluates anything itself; it forwards requests to
the sidecar and returns typed results.

## Install

```bash
uv pip install chio-sdk-python
# or
pip install chio-sdk-python
```

The package depends only on `httpx` and `pydantic`.

## Quickstart

```python
from chio_sdk import ChioClient
from chio_sdk.errors import ChioDeniedError


async def main() -> None:
    # Defaults to the local sidecar at http://127.0.0.1:9090.
    async with ChioClient() as client:
        await client.health()

        advisory = await client.evaluate_tool_call_advisory(
            capability_id="cap-123",
            tool_server="search-srv",
            tool_name="search_documents",
            parameters={"query": "capability-based security"},
        )
        print(f"advisory receipt: {advisory.id}")

        try:
            receipt = await client.evaluate_tool_call(
                capability_id="cap-123",
                tool_server="search-srv",
                tool_name="search_documents",
                parameters={"query": "capability-based security"},
            )
            print(f"advisory verdict receipt: {receipt.id}")
        except ChioDeniedError as error:
            print(f"not authorized: {error}")
```

Authoritative enforcement uses the kernel-mediated `POST /v1/evaluate` route,
which requires a full signed capability token and an execution nonce. The
id-only SDK wrappers hold a capability id, not a signed token, so
`evaluate_tool_call` (and the adapters built on it) take a `capability_id` and
delegate to the advisory `POST /v1/evaluate/advisory` route. The advisory route
returns `authorization: false`, `authorizationBasis: "advisory_only"`, and a
non-authoritative `ChioReceipt` (`trust_level == "advisory"`). Callers holding a
full signed token can drive the mediated route with
`evaluate_tool_call_mediated`.

Point the client at a non-default sidecar with `ChioClient(base_url=...)`.

## What is in the box

- `ChioClient` -- async client for sidecar health, capability minting and
  validation, fail-closed attenuation, receipt verification, and tool-call
  evaluation.
- Typed models -- `CapabilityToken`, `ChioScope`, `ToolGrant`,
  `ResourceGrant`, `PromptGrant`, `Operation`, `Constraint`, `Decision`,
  `Verdict`, `ChioReceipt`, `HttpReceipt`, `CallerIdentity`, and the
  supporting types. See `chio_sdk.models`.
- Errors -- `ChioError` and the `ChioConnectionError`,
  `ChioDeniedError`, `ChioTimeoutError`, `ChioValidationError`
  subclasses. Errors fail closed: a denial or an unreachable sidecar
  raises rather than silently allowing.

## Testing

The SDK ships a drop-in `MockChioClient` via `chio_sdk.testing`, with
`allow_all()`, `deny_all()`, and `with_policy(...)` helpers so you can
exercise capability-checked code paths without a running sidecar:

```python
from chio_sdk.testing import allow_all, deny_all
```
