## What is Chio

> MCP tells an agent *how* to call a tool.<br>
> A2A tells agents how to talk to each other.<br>
> **Chio proves what an agent was allowed to do, what it cost, and what happened.**

Chio is a Rust kernel that sits between an AI agent and everything it touches. Every tool
call, file read, API request, and payment goes through it, the same way every syscall goes
through an operating system kernel.

Before an agent can do anything, it presents a signed token that says who it is, what it
may call, and how much it may spend. Chio checks the token, runs the call, and writes a
signed receipt of what happened. **If the token does not check out, the call does not run.**

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/one-call-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/one-call.svg" alt="One tool call through Chio: the agent presents a signed token, the kernel verifies it, screens the request and result, dispatches to a sandboxed tool server, and signs a receipt. An expired token stops at verify and still produces a signed deny receipt." width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

An agent can hand a token to a sub-agent, but only a narrower one. It can drop tools,
shrink the budget, or shorten the expiry. **It cannot add anything back.** A swarm of
sub-agents never holds more authority than the agent that spawned it.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/attenuation-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/attenuation.svg" alt="Delegation in Chio only narrows: an orchestrator delegates to a planner, which delegates to a worker, and each token has fewer tools, a smaller budget, and a shorter expiry than its parent. A sub-worker token that tries to add the shell tool back is refused." width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

Every receipt records what the call cost and who paid. That is enough to give an agent a
balance, bill it per call, and let agents pay each other for work. Markets, credit, and
insurance in Chio are built on those receipts.

Agent swarms, security tooling, and cognition markets are built on those three things: the
token, the kernel, and the receipt.

## See it run

```sh
chio init my-agent && cd my-agent
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db --session-db ./session.db \
  check --policy policy.yaml --server hello --tool hello_world --params '{}'
```

The starter policy grants `hello_world` and nothing else, so the kernel allows the call and
signs a receipt for it:

```text
verdict:    ALLOW
tool:       hello_world
server:     hello
receipt_id: 356cab5605742b1bffd41eadbb8ebb269d50d3564a27ce3458efe063bcc64c5b
policy:     69e943b96e9ce64d0264bb56bf8930e77bd4e68adf68fcf1395790dae03e6b55
```

Ask for a tool the token does not cover and the call never runs. The refusal is signed too:

```sh
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db --session-db ./session.db \
  check --policy policy.yaml --server hello --tool drop_tables --params '{}'
```

```text
verdict:    DENY
tool:       drop_tables
server:     hello
reason:     requested tool drop_tables on server hello is not in capability scope
receipt_id: 6c9f6043cdbb6d9c05f372d2f0842b039c3397a9f131f25d2edb635c00ee0a4c
```

Both receipts are in the store. Explain one, then export the lot and verify the package with
no access to the kernel that wrote it:

```sh
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db receipt explain <receipt-id> --admin-all
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db evidence export --output ./evidence --admin-all
chio evidence verify --input ./evidence
```

```text
decision: deny
reason: requested tool drop_tables on server hello is not in capability scope
guard: kernel
repair_hint: inspect the guard and policy_hash, then mint or narrow a matching capability

evidence package verified
tool_receipts:          2
capability_lineage:     2
authorized_receipts:    1
verified_files:         12
```

This is a dry run, with no agent or tool server involved. The kernel produced two signed
decisions from a policy and a request, and anyone holding the package can check them offline.

## Why it is a kernel

An OS kernel is the one piece of code every program has to go through to reach the
hardware. It decides what a process may open, keeps processes away from each other, and
writes the audit log. Chio is that layer for agents, and each part has a direct counterpart.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/kernel-boundary-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/kernel-boundary.svg" alt="The Chio kernel boundary: agents, sub-agents, and tool servers run untrusted in user space; every call crosses into the kernel, which verifies, budgets, guards, dispatches, meters, and signs; protocol and provider adapters sit beneath it as drivers; every decision lands in an append-only receipt log." width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

| In an operating system | In Chio |
| --- | --- |
| **Syscalls** | Every tool call, file read, API request, and payment is dispatched by the kernel. An agent never holds a direct handle to a tool. |
| **Process isolation** | The kernel is the only trusted component. Agents and tool servers run as untrusted, sandboxed processes, isolated from each other and from the agent. |
| **Permissions** | Capability tokens: signed, expiring, budgeted, and only ever narrowable. |
| **Syscall filters** | A guard pipeline screens every request and every result. Custom guards run as fuel-metered WASM with no host access. |
| **Drivers** | MCP, A2A, ACP-Client, AG-UI, OpenAPI, and eight provider tool-call formats each lift to the same kernel verdict and lower back to their own wire format. |
| **Audit log** | An append-only, content-addressed receipt log with Merkle checkpoints. A receipt signed in Rust verifies byte-for-byte in TypeScript, Python, or Go. |
| **Resource accounting** | Per-call metering, with a budget hold taken before the call runs and sealed into the receipt. |
| **Portable core** | `chio-kernel-core` is `no_std` and takes its clock and RNG as traits. The same verify, evaluate, and sign code ships as a native sidecar, in the browser over wasm, and on iOS and Android over UniFFI. |
| **Verified core** | The admission path (verify, resolve, evaluate, sign) is modeled in Lean 4 with a published assumption boundary. |

</p>

## Why build on it

- **You do not write permissions, delegation, audit, metering, or billing for your agent system.** The kernel does them, and they behave the same over every protocol and provider it speaks.
- **Sub-agents cannot escalate.** A swarm holds at most the authority of the agent that spawned it, because every delegation proves it is a subset of its parent.
- **Actions leave a receipt that verifies offline.** Anyone with the public key can check what an agent did without access to your runtime.
- **Agents can pay each other.** Metering, budgets, markets, credit, and insurance clear on receipts the kernel already writes.
- **The model, the framework, and the tool servers are all swappable.** The kernel and the receipts do not change when you change any of them.
- **Deny is the default.** A token that does not verify, a budget that cannot be held, or a result that cannot be signed is a call that does not run.

## The three pillars

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/pillars-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/pillars.svg" alt="The three pillars of Chio: Proofs, Governance, and Economic Protocol, on a signed-receipt spine" width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

Three layers on one proof spine: every capability, decision, and payment resolves to a signed
receipt.

### Proofs

> Signed, attenuating capabilities go in. Forgery-resistant, independently verifiable receipts
> come out.

| Primitive | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Attenuated capabilities** | Ed25519-signed, time-bounded, budgeted tokens. Delegation proves it is a subset of its parent, so authority can only narrow, never widen. Post-quantum hybrid (ML-DSA-65) is supported. |
| **Forgery-resistant receipts** | Receipt identity is the hash of its own canonical content; the kernel recomputes that hash before signing and refuses on mismatch. `allow`, `deny`, `cancelled`, and `incomplete` are each signed. |
| **A verifiable log** | A content-addressed receipt DAG committed in RFC 6962 Merkle checkpoints. Canonical JSON (RFC 8785) makes a receipt signed in Rust verify byte-for-byte in TypeScript, Python, or Go. |
| **A Lean-4 modeled core** | The pure admission core (verify, resolve, evaluate, sign) is mechanically modeled with a published assumption boundary. |

### Governance

> Policy, identity, and delegated authority are native to the protocol, not bolted on.

| Primitive | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Policy that compiles to guards** | HushSpec YAML (allow / warn / deny, with inheritance) compiles directly into native guards. No external policy engine. |
| **A guard pipeline you can sandbox** | Forbidden-path, egress/SSRF, secret and PII/PHI, velocity, data-flow, jailbreak, and semantic SQL/vector checks. Custom guards run as fuel-metered WASM with no host access; cloud guardrails attach behind circuit breakers. |
| **Self-certifying identity** | A `did:chio` is the agent's Ed25519 key: no registry, no CA. Agent Passports and BBS+ selective disclosure travel with the agent and verify with no storage dependency. |
| **Authority without a central issuer** | Federation shares trust evidence while each operator activates locally. Governance charters, capability leases, and threshold multi-party approvals bind who may do what, to which request, for how long. |
| **One verifier for provenance** | A single fail-closed Sigstore verifier gates guard artifacts, signed model cards, and attestations; revocation is a signed sparse-Merkle oracle. |

### Economic protocol

> Every tool call is a priced, budgeted, metered transaction that settles into a signed receipt.

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Metering and budgets** | Per-call compute, data, and API cost, with durable pre-execution budget holds against a capability's caps, sealed into signed economic receipt metadata. |
| **Proof-carrying commerce** | One signed receipt binds what was authorized, how it was priced, what it metered, and how it settled, so credit and insurance decisions cite prior signed truth. |
| **Markets, credit, and insurance** | Discoverable service markets with open bidding and reputation-tiered pricing, credit lines and bonded execution, and liability underwriting and insurance. |
| **Settlement and anchoring** | On-chain settlement with cross-chain checkpoint anchoring across EVM, Bitcoin, and Solana, backed by the Chio settlement contracts. |

## Quickstart

Bond Claude Code to a policy in one line, then verify everything it did.

### 1. Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://www.chio.computer/install.sh | sh
```

<sub>Or from source: <code>git clone https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio.git && cd chio && cargo build --release -p chio-cli</code></sub>

### 2. Put Claude or Hermes under policy

Coding agents reach their file, shell, and git tools over MCP. Wrap that server with Chio so
every call is checked by the kernel and sealed into a signed receipt. The bundled `code-agent`
preset is a safe starting policy: reads are allowed, writes to `.env`, `.git/`, and `.ssh/` are
denied, and so is `git push --force`.

**Claude Code** registers the wrapped server in one line:

```sh
claude mcp add fs -- \
  chio --receipt-db ./chio.db mcp serve --preset code-agent --server-id fs -- \
  npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .
```

**Hermes** wraps the same server through its config. Add this under `mcp_servers` in
`~/.hermes/config.yaml`, then run `hermes mcp test chio` to confirm the edge is live:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  chio:
    command:
      - chio
      - --receipt-db
      - ./chio.db
      - mcp
      - serve
      - --preset
      - code-agent
      - --server-id
      - fs
      - --
      - npx
      - "-y"
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
      - "."
    transport: stdio
```

The `--server-id fs` must stay `fs`: the `code-agent` preset only grants capabilities to the
`fs`, `shell`, and `git` server ids, so any other id fail-closes every call.

Either way, you use the agent exactly as before; every tool call it routes through that server
is now checked against policy and sealed into a receipt.

To govern an entire session, including the agent's native tools, install the host plugin.

**Claude Code** ([chio-claude-code-plugin](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-claude-code-plugin)) installs from the marketplace, then bond a session with `/chio:bond <policy>`:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add backbay-labs/chio-claude-code-plugin
claude plugin install chio@chio
```

**Hermes** ([chio-hermes](docs/integrations/HERMES.md)) is not yet published to PyPI;
until it ships, follow the source install in the integration guide.

Enable the plugin and select its toolset in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (the `toolsets` entry is
required, otherwise the `chio_*` tools never surface):

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - chio
toolsets:
  - chio
```

`hermes setup` does not prompt for entry-point plugins, so set the sidecar URL and capability id
yourself, or write them to `~/.hermes/.env`. Mint the capability with `hermes chio issue`:

```sh
export CHIO_SIDECAR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9090
export CHIO_CAPABILITY_ID=<id from `hermes chio issue --json`>
```

### 3. Read the receipts

```sh
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db receipt list    --admin-all --limit 20
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db receipt explain <receipt-id> --admin-all
```

Every decision (allow, deny, cancelled, incomplete) is a signed, content-addressed receipt you
can verify offline.

### 4. Dry-run a policy, no agent required

```sh
chio init my-agent && cd my-agent

# allowed by the starter policy
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db --session-db ./session.db \
  check --policy policy.yaml --server hello --tool hello_world --params '{}'

# anything out of scope is denied, fail-closed
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db --session-db ./session.db \
  check --policy policy.yaml --server hello --tool drop_tables --params '{}'
```

The session database backs durable admission, which is on by default in the scaffold policy;
without it the kernel refuses to evaluate.

`chio init` scaffolds a project with an editable HushSpec `policy.yaml`; `chio check` evaluates
one tool call against it and prints the verdict.

### 5. Prove the agent's standing to a counterparty

```sh
# Mint an Agent Passport from the agent's signed receipt history
chio passport create --subject-public-key <agent-key> --signing-seed-file ./agent.seed --output passport.json

# A relying party evaluates it against their own bar, then admits or rejects the agent
chio passport evaluate --input passport.json --policy verifier-policy.yaml
```

An Agent Passport bundles the agent's `did:chio` identity and a signed reputation credential
built from its receipts. A counterparty verifies it with no shared server and, on accept, mints
it a scoped capability with `chio trust federated-issue`. This is how reputation and admission
cross operator boundaries.

### 6. Budget, meter, and settle

A capability caps what the agent may spend, and the kernel holds funds before each call and
denies anything over budget. Add ceilings to your policy (amounts in minor units, e.g. cents):

```yaml
# policy.yaml, under `rules:`
velocity:      { enabled: true, max_spend_per_window: 50000, window_secs: 60 }
human_in_loop: { enabled: true, approve_above: 15000, approve_above_currency: USD }
```

Every metered call records its cost in the receipt. Inspect spend and settlement:

```sh
chio --receipt-db ./chio.db receipt list --admin-all --min-cost 1 --cost-currency USD
chio settle status --store ./chio.db                                # pending, settled, dead-lettered
```

For a full market with buyers, providers, budgets, and settlement, run
[`examples/agent-commerce-network`](examples/agent-commerce-network).

---

**More:** `chio mcp serve-http` (hosted HTTP edge with OAuth/OIDC) &middot; `chio api` (zero-code
reverse proxy for any OpenAPI service) &middot; `chio federation` (cross-kernel treaties and
quorum) &middot; `chio trust` (revocation and trust-plane state).

## Architecture

Chio is layered around a single trusted core. External ecosystems enter through protocol
edges that turn them into governed tool servers. The **Runtime Kernel** mediates every call
and is the only trusted component. A **trust plane** (identity, credentials, federation,
governance) and an **economy plane** (metering, budgets, settlement) draw on the receipts the
kernel signs, and every decision is committed to the **Receipt Log**.

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/architecture-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="Chio system map: an untrusted agent and untrusted tool servers around a single trusted Runtime Kernel that verifies, guards, dispatches, and signs; capability authority and policy feed in, and receipts flow to the trust and economy planes" width="960" />
  </picture>
</p>

Only the Runtime Kernel is trusted (the TCB). The agent and tool servers are untrusted and
isolated, so a compromised agent or tool server cannot forge authorization or a receipt, and
any registry or artifact mismatch fails closed.

### Life of a tool call

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/lifecycle-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/lifecycle.svg" alt="Life of a tool call: present the token, verify it, hold the budget, guard the input, dispatch, guard the output, meter and sign, then commit the receipt to the Merkle log. A deny at verify, budget, or either guard stops the call and still produces a signed receipt." width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **1 &middot; Present** | The agent calls a tool and presents a capability token (Ed25519-signed, time-bounded, scoped) rather than ambient credentials. |
| **2 &middot; Verify** | The kernel runs the full capability check: signature and expiry, target within granted scope, delegation attenuates (the child scope is a proven subset of its parent), neither the capability nor any ancestor is revoked, and DPoP when the grant requires it. |
| **3 &middot; Budget** | If the grant carries monetary caps, the kernel places a durable pre-execution hold. An over-budget call is denied before anything runs. |
| **4 &middot; Guard (in)** | Input guards run in sequence over the parameters (forbidden paths, egress and SSRF, secrets, velocity, data-flow, jailbreak, semantic data checks). Any deny denies the call. |
| **5 &middot; Dispatch** | Only the kernel dispatches to the tool server. The agent never holds a handle to it. |
| **6 &middot; Guard (out)** | The result passes back through output and post-invocation guards (PII/PHI sanitization, anomaly and data-transfer checks). |
| **7 &middot; Meter and sign** | The kernel reconciles the budget hold to actual cost, assembles the receipt (decision, policy hash, guard evidence, economic metadata), recomputes the content hash inside its trust boundary, and signs it. A call it cannot sign is not allowed. |
| **8 &middot; Commit** | The receipt is written to the content-addressed log and folded into a Merkle checkpoint, where its evidence is available to the trust and economy planes. |

Every outcome (`allow`, `deny`, `cancelled`, `incomplete`) produces a signed receipt.

### The codebase

The workspace ships 100+ crates across 11 groups.

| Group | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Shared types (capabilities, receipts, canonical JSON, signing), errors, adversarial suite |
| `kernel` | Capability validation, guard pipeline, receipt signing, runtime and platform variants |
| `guards` | Native, data-layer, WASM, and external guards, plus HushSpec policy and the guard registry |
| `protocol` | The 27 protocol and provider edges (MCP, A2A, ACP-Client, AG-UI, OpenAPI, provider dialects, Tower, Envoy) |
| `economy` | Metering, budgets, pricing, markets, credit, settlement, anchoring, web3 bindings |
| `trust` | `did:chio`, credentials and passports, federation, governance, reputation, attestation, TEE, model cards |
| `observability` | SIEM export, lineage, log redaction, metrics, OTel receipt export |
| `platform` | Control plane, stores, signed manifests, config, workflow, HTTP and session primitives |
| `products` | The `chio` CLI, API Protect, Chio-Wall, MERCURY, Proof Room |
| `sdk` | Guard-authoring SDK, FFI bindings, receipt evaluation helpers |
| `tooling` | Conformance suite, spec codegen and validation, LSP, test support |

The crates most users touch are the `chio` CLI (`chio-cli`), `chio-api-protect` (a zero-code
reverse proxy that protects HTTP APIs with Chio receipts), and the libraries `chio-kernel`,
`chio-policy`, and `chio-guards`. The full crate map and component detail live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/).

## Integrations and SDKs

One kernel. Every major agent-interop protocol, eight provider tool-call dialects, eight
language SDKs, and 60+ framework, runtime, and infrastructure integrations. Chio wraps
existing ecosystems instead of replacing them: MCP, A2A, ACP-Client, AG-UI, OpenAPI, and provider
tool formats become governed Chio tool servers, while the kernel keeps dispatch and receipt
authority for the surfaces it mediates.

### Ecosystem and plugins

Beyond this repository, the [`backbay-labs`](https://github.com/backbay-labs) org ships
companion plugins that bond an agent, IDE, or chat platform to a Chio policy. Each is a
separate repo built on the shared `@chio/bridge` library and the `chio` CLI, so any host can
mediate every tool call through the kernel and stream signed receipts.

| Plugin | Repo | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | [chio-claude-code-plugin](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-claude-code-plugin) | Bonds any Claude Code session; mediates Bash/Write/Edit/Read and every MCP server, metered and receipt-signed |
| **Cursor** | [chio-cursor-plugin](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-cursor-plugin) | Bonds Composer, the Agent tab, inline AI, and mounted MCP servers via native Cursor hooks |
| **Codex** | [chio-codex-plugin](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-codex-plugin) | Bonds the OpenAI Codex CLI plan-then-act loop through the guard pipeline, with attested plans |
| **OpenCode** | [chio-open-code-plugin](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-open-code-plugin) | Native OpenCode TUI plugin: scaffold, wrap, and ship bonded agents |
| **OpenClaw** | [chio-open-claw-plugin](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-open-claw-plugin) | A hosted Chio edge in Slack, Discord, and Telegram: mention to propose a policy, passkey-countersign, then a bonded agent streams receipts to the thread |

Two demos worth a look: [chio-showcase](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-showcase) (an
"Internet of Agents" demo of four organizations transacting through Chio-mediated agent
commerce) and
[chio-hedge-fund-demo](https://github.com/backbay-labs/chio-hedge-fund-demo) (one sentence in
Claude Code becomes a bonded operator placing budget-gated paper trades with verifiable
receipts).

## Security and trust

<p align="center">

    <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="docs/assets/security-mobile.svg" />
    <img src="docs/assets/security.svg" alt="Chio defense in depth: a trusted core, fail-closed admission, a guard pipeline, active defense, and signed evidence" width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

The kernel is the entire trusted base. Around it, five layers of defense, each one fail-closed:

- **Trusted core.** Only the Runtime Kernel is trusted (the TCB). The agent and tool servers are
  untrusted and isolated, and the kernel never leaks its address or signing key.
- **Fail-closed by construction.** Errors deny access, invalid policy is rejected at load, and
  the kernel will not allow a call it cannot also sign a receipt for.
- **Guard pipeline.** Native, data-layer, sandboxed WASM, and external guards screen every input
  and output before it crosses a trust boundary.
- **Active defense.** Information-flow control, deception (canary capabilities and honey-tools),
  and reversible quarantine correlate and contain anomalous behavior.
- **Signed evidence.** Every decision is sealed into a canonical-JSON (RFC 8785),
  post-quantum-ready receipt, so receipts and attestations verify byte-for-byte across languages.

Chio names 20 threats in [spec/SECURITY.md](spec/SECURITY.md), each with shipped controls,
required mitigations, and residual risk, tracked at
[docs/security/threat-coverage.md](docs/security/threat-coverage.md). Report vulnerabilities
privately per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Roadmap

    <img src="docs/assets/roadmap.svg" alt="Chio roadmap timeline: a monthly sprint from August 2026 to March 2027 (Q1 2027), culminating in Chiodos: sovereign agent economies" width="900" />
  </picture>
</p>

The protocol is in place. What follows is the frontier it opens: an agent economy that is
sovereign, provable, and self-governing. We are shipping the whole arc on a monthly cadence,
targeting completion by Q1 2027; the windows below are indicative.

- **Aug 2026 &middot; The open authority standard.** A neutral, published protocol and a public
  certification program for third-party runtimes: the interoperable trust layer for the whole
  agent internet, owned by no one.
- **Sep 2026 &middot; A machine-checked kernel, end to end.** Extend the Lean 4 proof boundary
  from the decision core to the entire kernel and wire protocol: a trust base that is proven
  correct, not merely tested.
- **Oct 2026 &middot; The global receipt commons.** A federated, anti-equivocation transparency
  log for agent action: a public, searchable commons of proofs with independent monitors, so any
  claim about any agent can be checked by anyone.
- **Nov 2026 &middot; Proof-carrying money.** A universal settlement fabric where value itself
  carries provenance: one receipt standard that clears across every chain and rail, so a payment
  always knows where it came from and what it was authorized to do.
- **Dec 2026 &middot; Zero-knowledge compliance.** Prove KYC/AML, jurisdiction, data-residency,
  and policy adherence about an agent's actions without revealing the underlying data. Regulation
  anyone can verify; privacy no one has to surrender.
- **Jan 2027 &middot; Autonomous risk markets.** Live underwriting where an agent's signed history
  prices its own credit and insurance in real time. Reputation becomes collateral and premiums
  self-tune, so trust can be bought, sold, and hedged like any other asset.
- **Feb 2027 &middot; Swarm immunity.** Decoys, information-flow control, and quarantine composed
  into a fleet-wide immune system that shares threat intelligence across federated operators and
  adapts to new attacks in real time.
- **Mar 2027 &middot; Chiodos: sovereign agent economies.** Chartered digital nation-states of
  agents, each with its own treasury, constitution, and monetary policy, transacting across
  borders under signed treaties. Economic sovereignty as a first-class protocol primitive.

## Formal verification

The formal model behind Chio is written up in
[**Programmable Sovereignty**](docs/papers/programmable-sovereignty), a machine-checked account
of how agents and organizations govern themselves through capability-bounded, federated receipts.

The formal verification roadmap was executed through its local acceptance
gates on 2026-07-15 against implementation commit
`d292f14df1c493873199f4f9d969ade00472ff28`. Retained full-cycle proof-mutation
evidence was refreshed on 2026-07-16 against prerequisite commit
`a871396bffd010500f680c035e7b52c1867f38e2`. The repository now binds
production Rust decisions to Lean, authenticated Aeneas extraction, Creusot
contracts, Kani harnesses, TLA+/Apalache models, differential tests,
concurrency exploration, and mutation evidence. The generated
[proof coverage matrix](docs/formal/COVERAGE.md) is the authoritative map from
properties to models, production symbols, assumptions, and gates.

All hygiene items and 22 of the 23 planned work items are implemented. The
remaining economy collection proof is blocked on the unmerged netting surface;
its scalar conservation predicates and Kani groundwork are present, but no
collection-level claim is made. Hosted CI streaks remain advisory evidence and
are not represented as local proof results. See the
[current-state snapshot](docs/formal/CURRENT_STATE.md) and the
[executed roadmap](docs/formal/ROADMAP.md) for exact scope and limitations.
