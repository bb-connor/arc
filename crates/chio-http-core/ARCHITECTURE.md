# chio-http-core Architecture

## Boundary

`chio-http-core` owns the transport-neutral HTTP security model used by proxy,
sidecar, and framework adapters. Its public surface is deliberately DTO-heavy:
request and identity models, HTTP authority evaluation, HTTP receipts, verdict
wire shapes, route registrations, and substrate-independent admin handlers.

The crate depends on `chio-core-types` for canonical JSON, capabilities,
receipts, and key material; on `chio-kernel` for kernel-backed authority
projection and execution nonces; and on `chio-egress-contract` for typed
outbound HTTP egress policy. HTTP adapters and products depend on this crate
for stable wire shapes, so public API compatibility matters.

## Module Boundaries

- `request`, `identity`, `method`, `session`, `verdict`, and `receipt` define
  serializable HTTP-facing primitives and receipt bindings.
- `authority` owns kernel-backed HTTP request authorization and signed HTTP
  decision/final receipts.
- `egress` re-exports the leaf egress contract so adapters can depend on one
  HTTP-facing crate.
- `approvals`, `emergency`, `plan`, `compliance`, and `regulatory_api` expose
  handler-level admin and audit workflows without embedding a web framework.
- `routes` centralizes route and header constants consumed by adapters.

## Pain Points

- `authority.rs` mixes several trust boundaries in one file: reserved
  `/chio/tools` path identity decoding, request-field capability binding,
  kernel projection payloads, kernel invocation, transport-deny receipt
  signing, and authority tests.
- The reserved `/chio/tools/{server}/{tool}` path is security-sensitive because
  path-derived identity must override spoofable request fields and must fail
  closed on malformed path identity.
- The kernel projection payload is an internal wire contract between
  `HttpAuthority` and its private `HttpProjectionGuard`; keeping that payload
  close to binding logic makes the intended authority boundary easier to audit.

## Security And API Constraints

- Public DTO and route wire shapes must remain backward compatible.
- HTTP receipt signing must preserve canonical JSON byte stability, receipt id
  validation, signed metadata semantics, and decision/final status metadata.
- Deny-by-default routes must continue requiring a valid capability unless the
  route is explicitly session-allow.
- Reserved `/chio/tools` paths must bind to the decoded path identity, not to
  request fields supplied by an adapter.
- Malformed reserved tool paths must deny before a wildcard or HTTP-authority
  grant can accidentally authorize the request.

## Affected Dependents

Direct dependents include `chio-api-protect`, `chio-envoy-ext-authz`,
`chio-openapi`, `chio-config`, `chio-conformance`, SDK middleware crates, and
tests that import HTTP DTOs and route constants. This slice does not change the
public API. Dependent behavior is covered by the `chio-http-core` authority
tests and by the crate-level test and clippy gates.

## Planned Improvement

Split the private HTTP authority projection and capability-binding logic out of
`authority.rs` into a focused internal module. Keep `HttpAuthority` responsible
for orchestration, kernel invocation, and receipt signing, while the new module
owns:

- reserved `/chio/tools` path identity parsing,
- request-field versus path-derived capability binding,
- malformed path fail-closed reasons,
- kernel authorization request payloads and capability state.

The change is architectural because it separates the most sensitive binding
decision from receipt signing and kernel orchestration without changing public
wire contracts.
