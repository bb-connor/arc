//! Timing-leak dudect harness for MAC (signature byte) equality compare.
//!
//! Source-doc anchor: `.planning/trajectory/02-fuzzing-post-pr13.md`
//! Phase 3 atomic task P3.T5 + the "Timing-leak (dudect) harness" section.
//!
//! Gated behind the `dudect` Cargo feature so default `cargo test -p
//! chio-kernel-core` is unaffected; opt in via:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test -p chio-kernel-core --features dudect --release mac_eq
//! ```
//!
//! # What this harness measures
//!
//! Chio kernel-core's signature-verification path returns `false` from
//! [`chio_core_types::crypto::PublicKey::verify`] when the supplied
//! signature does not match the message. The portable receipt and passport
//! verifiers compare `Signature` blobs by bytes (see
//! `chio_core_types::crypto::Signature`'s `PartialEq` impl, which uses
//! `==` on the underlying `[u8; 64]` for Ed25519). That byte-equality
//! compare is the closest in-tree analogue of an HMAC-tag compare, which
//! is the canonical "MAC eq" surface that any constant-time crypto code
//! has to keep data-independent.
//!
//! The harness drives two input classes through the byte-equality compare:
//!
//! - `Class::Left`: two signatures that differ at the **first** byte.
//!   A naive `==` short-circuits early; a constant-time compare runs
//!   through every byte.
//! - `Class::Right`: two signatures that differ at the **last** byte.
//!   A naive `==` runs through almost every byte before short-circuiting.
//!
//! If the runtime distributions are statistically distinguishable
//! (Welch's t > 4.5 in two consecutive runs), the compare path is a
//! variable-time short-circuit. The CI lane `.github/workflows/dudect.yml`
//! (M02.P2.T4) wires this harness into nightly + PR-time runs with the
//! two-consecutive-runs `t < 4.5` pass rule.
//!
//! # Why the trust-boundary surface, not the wrapper
//!
//! `chio-kernel-core` does not expose its own `mac_eq` symbol; the kernel
//! delegates byte-equality to the `Signature` type from `chio-core-types`,
//! which is part of the same trust boundary set. Measuring the underlying
//! `==` directly catches the leak at its source rather than smearing it
//! through a wrapper that would dilute the signal.
