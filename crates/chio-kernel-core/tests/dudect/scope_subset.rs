//! Timing-leak dudect harness for capability scope-subset evaluation.
//!
//! Source-doc anchor: `.planning/trajectory/02-fuzzing-post-pr13.md`
//! Phase 3 atomic task P3.T5 + the "Timing-leak (dudect) harness" section.
//!
//! Gated behind the `dudect` Cargo feature so default `cargo test -p
//! chio-kernel-core` is unaffected; opt in via:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test -p chio-kernel-core --features dudect --release scope_subset
//! ```
//!
//! # What this harness measures
//!
//! [`chio_kernel_core::NormalizedScope::is_subset_of`] is the authoritative
//! capability-algebra subset check used by the proof-facing evaluation
//! lane. It walks the child scope's tool grants and asks whether each one
//! is covered by any grant in the parent scope (`grants.iter().all(|g|
//! parent.grants.iter().any(|p| g.is_subset_of(p)))`). The inner
//! short-circuit (`Iterator::any`) returns as soon as a covering parent
//! grant is found.
//!
//! Whether the input data influences how *quickly* the subset check
//! resolves is the question this harness asks. The two input classes
//! place the matching parent grant at different positions:
//!
//! - `Class::Left`: the matching parent grant is the **first** entry of
//!   the parent's `grants` vector. The `any(...)` predicate short-circuits
//!   on the first iteration.
//! - `Class::Right`: the matching parent grant is the **last** entry of
//!   the parent's `grants` vector. The `any(...)` predicate runs through
//!   every entry before short-circuiting.
//!
//! Both classes resolve to the same verdict (`true`); the harness asks
//! whether the time taken to reach that verdict is data-dependent in a
//! way that an off-path attacker could use to learn something about
//! which parent grant matched. If the runtime distributions are
//! statistically distinguishable (Welch's t > 4.5 in two consecutive
//! runs), the subset check is timing-leaky.
//!
//! # Why this matters
//!
//! Scope evaluation lives on the verdict-producing hot path of every
//! capability-bearing tool call. A timing leak here would let a tenant
//! learn the structure of another tenant's parent capability through
//! response-time analysis. A `t < 4.5` result in two consecutive CI runs
//! is the documented pass criterion (`.github/workflows/dudect.yml`,
//! M02.P2.T4).
