//! Web Crypto RNG adapter.
//!
//! Wraps `crypto.getRandomValues()` so the portable
//! [`arc_kernel_core::Rng`] trait can source CSPRNG-quality entropy
//! inside a browser. Used by the signing path to build a fresh Ed25519
//! seed per `sign_receipt` call when the caller does not already have a
//! long-lived kernel key, and to mint receipt identifiers.
//!
//! The adapter fails closed: if the runtime has no `window.crypto`
//! global (e.g. a non-browser wasm32 host that does not polyfill the Web
//! Crypto API), the [`WebCryptoRng::try_new`] constructor returns
//! [`WebCryptoRngError::Unavailable`]. The kernel-core `Rng` trait's
//! `fill_bytes` has no error channel, so once the adapter is constructed
//! a later `fill_bytes` call that fails for any reason falls back to
//! zeroing the destination buffer; callers that depend on entropy (such
//! as the receipt-signing path in this crate) detect a zero-filled
//! seed up-front and refuse to sign with structured error.
