# chio-acp-proxy Architecture Notes

## Module Boundaries

`lib.rs` currently flattens the crate with `include!` so public ACP wire types,
guards, kernel integration traits, telemetry helpers, transport, and tests all
share one crate-root namespace. The practical boundaries are still visible:
`protocol.rs` owns ACP JSON-RPC wire shapes and method discrimination,
`interceptor.rs` owns request routing and fail-closed policy decisions,
`fs_guard.rs` and `terminal_guard.rs` own built-in local guards,
`kernel_checker.rs` and `kernel_signer.rs` adapt live ACP operations into
kernel-backed authorization and receipt flows, and `transport.rs` plus
`proxy.rs` own subprocess stdio orchestration.

## Completed Permission Boundary Slice

The guarded fs, terminal, lifecycle, receipt-producing session-update, and
permission paths now validate boundary identifiers before they become
capability, pending-context, receipt, or user-decision correlation keys.
Earlier versions treated malformed `session/request_permission` params as
best-effort logging input and forwarded the request, so empty `sessionId` or
option ids could cross into the editor/user decision boundary without a
trustworthy ACP correlation key.

## Security and API Constraints

The public root exports must remain source-compatible because downstream crates
consume the flattened ACP proxy types directly. The proxy must keep fail-closed
guard ordering: live capability checker first when present, then built-in path
or command guard, then forwarding. Canonical JSON hashes for authorization
params and ACP audit entries must remain byte-stable. Standalone unsigned mode
must remain available, but it cannot silently treat malformed session or tool
identifiers as useful compliance evidence.

## Affected Dependents

`chio-kernel` and tests using `KernelCapabilityChecker`, `KernelReceiptSigner`,
`AcpCapabilityRequest`, `AcpToolCallAuditEntry`, and `MessageInterceptor` rely
on the existing public type names. No transitive crate edits are planned unless
focused gates reveal downstream breakage from stricter malformed-message
handling.

## Completed Material Improvement

Extend the existing ACP boundary identifier validation in `protocol.rs` to
`session/request_permission` and have `MessageInterceptor` require valid params
whenever the request supplies them. Non-empty `sessionId` remains required for
guarded operations, non-empty `toolCallId` remains required before ACP
`session/update` can generate a receipt-bearing audit entry, and permission
requests with option lists must carry non-empty option ids before they cross the
user decision boundary. This keeps no-params compatibility while rejecting
malformed permission correlation evidence without changing the public root API
shape.

## Session Update Params Boundary Slice

### Current Boundary

`session/update` is the agent-to-client notification path that can produce ACP
tool-call audit entries and signed Chio receipts. `interceptor.rs` parses it
into `SessionUpdateNotification`, validates the `sessionId`, then parses
security-relevant `toolCall` and `toolCallUpdate` updates before receipt
generation.

### Pain Point

The interceptor currently treats missing or malformed `session/update` params as
an uninteresting update and forwards the message unchanged. That is too weak for
a receipt boundary: a recognized method with invalid params should not cross the
proxy as unaudited traffic just because parsing failed.

### Security and API Constraints

The public flattened root API and ACP wire structs must remain unchanged.
Unknown methods can still forward for forward compatibility. Recognized
`session/update` messages must fail closed when their params are absent or do not
decode into the ACP notification shape, while valid non-tool updates continue to
forward without receipts.

### Affected Dependents

Only the owning crate tests are expected to change. Downstream crates observe the
same `AcpProxyError::Protocol` error shape already used by guarded ACP methods
with missing or invalid params.

### Completed Material Improvement

Route `session/update` through the same params-required decoding boundary used
by guarded fs, terminal, and permission methods. Missing params and malformed
params should return protocol errors before forwarding; valid non-tool updates
should still pass through, and valid tool updates should preserve the existing
receipt behavior.

## Blocked Request Context Isolation Slice

### Current Boundary

`interceptor.rs` is the trust boundary between ACP JSON-RPC traffic and Chio
authorization evidence. It captures live capability contexts after successful
kernel checks, stores pending contexts for ACP requests that do not yet carry a
`toolCallId`, and later attaches those contexts to `session/update` receipts.

### Pain Point

Guard-denied or checker-denied fs and terminal-create requests currently call
`clear_capability_context(session_id)`. That clears every live and pending
authorization context in the session, not just any context associated with the
blocked request. A denied unrelated operation can therefore downgrade later
receipts for already-authorized tool calls to `AuditOnly` or discard pending
evidence for authorized requests that have not emitted their ACP `toolCallId`
yet.

### Security and API Constraints

The public flattened root API, `InterceptResult` variants, ACP wire structs,
canonical parameter hashes, and receipt field semantics must remain unchanged.
Denied requests must still fail closed and must not leave behind a context for
the denied request. The fix must preserve guard ordering: capability checker
first when installed, then built-in guard, then forwarding.

### Affected Dependents

`chio-cli` depends on `chio-acp-proxy`, but no transitive public API change is
planned. The expected compatibility proof is the owning crate test suite plus a
targeted `chio-cli` check if the crate compiles cleanly.

### Completed Material Improvement

Replace session-wide context clearing on blocked fs and terminal-create paths
with request-scoped cleanup. If the blocked request carried a `toolCallId`, only
that live context is removed; requests without a `toolCallId` have not been
buffered yet and require no cleanup. Add regression tests proving that a denied
request cannot erase unrelated live or pending authorization evidence.

## Session Cancel Params Boundary Slice

### Current Boundary

`session/cancel` is the lifecycle cleanup path for live and pending ACP
authorization contexts. It clears the per-session pending FIFO and the
`tool:<session>:*` live context index so cancelled sessions do not retain
authorization material.

### Pain Point

The interceptor currently treats `session/cancel` params as optional. Missing,
non-object, or blank `sessionId` values are forwarded unchanged and do not drain
any context. That is weaker than the rest of the recognized ACP lifecycle
surface: malformed cancel messages can cross the proxy as if they were valid
control messages while leaving captured authorization evidence alive.

### Security and API Constraints

The public flattened root API must remain source-compatible. Valid
`session/cancel` messages should still forward unchanged after context cleanup.
Malformed `session/cancel` messages should fail closed with the existing
`AcpProxyError::Protocol` shape used by guarded ACP methods. Unknown ACP
methods still forward for forward compatibility.

### Affected Dependents

Only owning-crate tests are expected to change. No downstream API or wire shape
change is planned for valid cancel messages.

### Completed Material Improvement

Add typed `session/cancel` params validation and route the method through the
same params-required decode boundary as guarded fs, terminal, permission, and
session-update methods. Add regression coverage proving malformed cancel
messages fail before forwarding and do not drain unrelated pending contexts.
