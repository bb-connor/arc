/// Recursive-delegation mint helper.

/// enforcement and emits a [`DelegationReceipt`] alongside the signed
/// link. Returns `Err` (denying the mint) when any of:
///
/// * The parent token's scope does not explicitly authorize
///   [`Operation::Delegate`].
/// * The proposed `child_scope` is not a subset of the parent token's
///   scope (rejected by [`validate_attenuation`]).
/// * Any `attenuation.steps` entry is not a true narrowing of the parent
///   (raises a cap, targets a tool outside the parent scope, or extends
///   expiry). Steps are validated reduce-only rather than copied verbatim, and
///   each is checked against *every* covering parent grant so an overlapping
///   `*:*` grant cannot mask a concrete grant that holds the targeted
///   operation or cost cap.
/// * Any declared step is not actually reflected in `child_scope` /
///   `child_expires_at` (for example an `AddConstraint` step whose constraint
///   the child grant omits). This mirrors chio-kernel's declared-attenuation
///   validation so the helper never emits a receipt whose signed link and child
///   scope disagree.
/// * `attenuation.budget_share_bps` exceeds the parent's share. The share is
///   parent-relative: a child can never claim a larger fraction of the budget
///   than the parent holds (an absent parent share is treated as 100%). When
///   the parent holds a share strictly below the 100% ceiling, the child MUST
///   state an explicit `budget_share_bps`: omission is rejected fail-closed
///   because downstream admission treats a missing share as the full budget (a
///   widening). A parent at the full ceiling (`None` or `Some(10_000)`) accepts
///   an omitted child share as a no-op.
/// * The requested `child_expires_at` is greater than the parent's
///   `expires_at` (rejected as an [`Error::AttenuationViolation`]).
/// * `delegator_keypair.public_key() != parent.subject` (the mint helper
///   is fail-closed: only the parent capability's bound subject may
///   delegate further).
///
/// The helper is intentionally pure with respect to the local clock:
/// callers pass `signed_at` and `nonce` explicitly so unit tests, replay
/// proofs, and proptest-driven invariants stay deterministic.
