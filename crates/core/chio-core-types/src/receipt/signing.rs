/// forgery. A signature over such a body says nothing about the content the

///
/// `ReceiptSigningHandle` closes that gap. It is constructed *inside the trust
/// boundary* from the exact canonical content the producer evaluated; at
/// construction time it recomputes `content_hash = sha256_hex(canonical_content)`
/// and stores both the immutable canonical bytes and the authoritative hash.
/// The signing entrypoints that take a handle then refuse to sign unless the
/// body's claimed `content_hash` equals the handle's recomputed hash
/// ([`ContentHashMismatch`], fail-closed).
///
/// # One-time semantics
///
/// The handle is **move-only** (no `Clone`): the signing entrypoints consume it
/// by value, so a single handle corresponds to a single signing attempt over a
/// single evaluated artifact. A producer cannot reuse one handle to back two
/// different signatures, and cannot smuggle a handle built over content `A`
/// into a sign call for content `B` -- the recomputed hash is fixed at
/// construction and the body's claim is checked against it.

///
/// In the present change the handle is built from canonical content bytes that
/// the producer supplies via [`ReceiptSigningHandle::from_content`] /
/// [`ReceiptSigningHandle::from_canonical_bytes`]. The intended end state is
/// that `evaluate()` *returns* the handle (so the only way to obtain one is to
/// have actually run an evaluation, and the bytes are the evaluator's own
/// canonical output rather than anything the caller chose). Threading the
