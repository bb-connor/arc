# chio-openapi Architecture Note

## Boundaries

- `src/parser.rs` owns OpenAPI 3.x JSON/YAML ingestion, required-field checks,
  local `$ref` resolution, and the intermediate `OpenApiSpec` model.
- `src/generator.rs` owns conversion from `OpenApiSpec` into
  `chio_core_types::ToolDefinition`, including parameter merging, input schema
  construction, output schema selection, and tool annotations.
- `src/extensions.rs` owns `x-chio-*` operation extension parsing.
- `src/policy.rs` owns default method-based policy decisions and extension
  overrides.
- `src/lib.rs` exposes the stable public API and the `tools_from_spec`
  convenience path.

## Pain Points

- The parser is the ingest trust boundary for operator-supplied OpenAPI specs,
  and downstream bridge code assumes parsed parameters are intentional.
- The normative OpenAPI integration spec requires each parameter to include
  `name` and `in`, but `parse_single_parameter` silently treats a missing or
  malformed `in` as a query parameter. That can publish an invalid contract as
  a valid tool input and route bridged calls with a broader input surface than
  the API author declared.
- Unknown `in` values are deliberately compatible with the current spec and
  still default to query. The unsafe gap is absence or non-string shape, not an
  explicitly unknown string.

## Security And API Constraints

- Preserve the public structs and function signatures.
- Preserve JSON/YAML auto-detection and local-only `$ref` resolution.
- Preserve deterministic path ordering and method ordering.
- Preserve generator behavior for valid specs, including canonical tool input
  schemas and method-derived annotations.
- Fail closed at the malformed-spec boundary before generating tools or bridge
  route bindings.

## Affected Dependents

- `crates/chio-openapi-mcp-bridge` calls `OpenApiSpec::parse` before building
  route bindings and manifests. It should inherit stricter parameter validation
  without code changes.
- `spec/OPENAPI-INTEGRATION.md` is the normative contract for this crate and
  already requires parameter `in` to be present.

## Planned Improvement

Reject parameters whose `in` field is absent, empty, or not a string. Keep the
existing compatibility behavior for explicitly unknown string locations by
mapping them to query, matching the current integration spec text.
