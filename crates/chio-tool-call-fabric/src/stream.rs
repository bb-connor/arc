//! Streaming state machine for the tool-call fabric.
//!
//! The fabric mediates provider streams (OpenAI SSE, Anthropic event-stream,
//! Bedrock `ConverseStream`) at the tool-use block boundary: events are
//! buffered while the kernel resolves a verdict for the enclosing block, then
//! flushed once the verdict allows or dropped if it denies. See
//! `.planning/trajectory/07-provider-native-adapters.md` Phase 1 task 3 and the
//! "Streaming verdict semantics" section for the behavioral contract.
//!
//! This module ships the bare state-machine scaffold for that contract:
//!
//! - [`StreamPhase`] is the finite-state enum every adapter drives.
//! - [`BufferedBlock`] is the per-block buffer carried while the phase is
//!   [`StreamPhase::Buffering`].
//! - [`BlockKind`] tags whether the block represents a tool call, a tool
//!   result, plain text, or some other provider construct.
//! - [`StreamEvent`] enumerates the inputs that drive transitions.
//! - [`StreamError`] reports invalid transitions.
//!
//! Phase 1 of M07 ships transitions only; provider-specific wiring (SSE
//! parsing, kernel verdict calls, synthetic deny emission) lands in the
//! per-provider adapters.
