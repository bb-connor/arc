//! Purchase-aware admission seam for delivery-committed finding reveals.
//!
//! A grant carrying [`Constraint::RequireFindingPurchase`] authorizes
//! exactly one purchased reveal. The kernel cannot depend on the market
//! crates that define the purchase artifacts, so verification is injected
//! behind [`FindingPurchaseVerifier`] the same way payment rails are: the
//! production implementation strict-parses the signed purchase context and
//! reads the authoritative reservation store, while the kernel owns the
//! fail-closed wiring and the cross-checks that bind the verified result
//! to the selected grant, the request, and the paying capability.
//!
//! The seam is split into a deterministic half and an admission-time half.
//! [`FindingPurchaseVerifier::verify_purchase`] must be a pure function of
//! the carrier bytes and marker: the durable finalizer re-runs it after a
//! crash from the frozen request, so any clock or store read there would
//! make recovery diverge from admission. Liveness bounds and reservation
//! state belong in
//! [`FindingPurchaseVerifier::verify_purchase_admission`], which runs only
//! before dispatch.
