//! Kernel boot path: gate the PQ signing key load on a self-quote.
//!
//! The PQ signing key load is gated on a verified self-quote that binds the
//! `expect_report_data` and hybrid-signing paths. Boot order:
//!
//! 1. The kernel comes up with its classical Ed25519 keypair already
//!    materialized. No PQ key has been touched.
//! 2. The kernel requests its own TEE quote from the surrounding
//!    `chio-tee` container and feeds the bytes into a
//!    verifier-side [`KernelSelfQuoteVerifier`]. The quote
//!    MUST commit to `expect_report_data(kernel_classical_pk,
//!    receipt_root_genesis)` where `receipt_root_genesis` is the all-zero
//!    32-byte sentinel `[0u8; 32]` representing the empty receipt-tree root
//!    at boot.
//! 3. Only after the verifier returns success does the kernel derive the
//!    [`MlDsa65Backend`](chio_core_types::pq::MlDsa65Backend) from the
//!    operator-supplied seed and compose the
//!    [`HybridBackend`](chio_core_types::pq::HybridBackend). Any failure in
//!    step 2 leaves the kernel running classical-only and the boot path
//!    returns an error: under `crypto_floor=allow_hybrid` or
//!    `crypto_floor=pq_required` the operator MUST refuse to start signing.
//!
//! ## Why a port trait rather than a hard `chio-attest-verify` dep
//!
//! `chio-kernel` does not depend on `chio-attest-verify` and this module
//! preserves that boundary. The verifier crate today carries TDX/SEV-SNP/
//! Nitro backends each pulled in behind a cargo feature; the kernel does
//! not need any of them at boot time. The port trait below is small enough
//! to implement against `chio-attest-verify`'s `QuoteVerifier` by a
//! one-line shim in the operator binary that wires the two crates together,
//! and small enough to implement against an in-memory mock for the
//! integration test.
//!
//! ## Trust-boundary discipline
//!
//! - Fail-closed: every error path returns
//!   [`KernelBootError`] without producing a [`HybridBackend`].
//! - The kernel signing key (the classical Ed25519 key plus the PQ
//!   composition) is never returned partially. Callers that ask for a
//!   hybrid backend either get one fully gated by a verified self-quote
//!   or they get an error.
//! - `receipt_root_genesis` is the [`RECEIPT_ROOT_GENESIS`] constant.
//!   Production callers MUST NOT thread their current receipt root in;
//!   the genesis quote binds to the empty tree so the chain has a fixed
//!   cryptographic anchor independent of the first receipt's contents.
