//! Plan-level evaluation DTOs (Phase 2.4).
//!
//! An agent planner can submit an ordered list of planned tool calls to
//! the kernel for a pre-flight evaluation. The kernel evaluates every
//! step independently against the planner's capability and the
//! pre-invocation portion of the guard pipeline, then returns per-step
//! verdicts so the caller can replan or abort early BEFORE any tool has
//! actually executed.
//!
//! Plan evaluation is intentionally stateless and pure: the kernel
//! performs no receipt emission, no budget mutation, no capability
//! revocation, and no tool-server dispatch. Dependencies between steps
//! are advisory metadata only in v1; the kernel does not topologically
//! sort the graph, refuse on cycles, or short-circuit downstream steps
//! when an earlier step is denied.
//!
//! Wire shapes below are the canonical JSON representations served by
//! `POST /evaluate-plan`. The endpoint returns `200 OK` with a
//! `PlanEvaluationResponse` regardless of the aggregate verdict:
//! denials are conveyed in the JSON, not as HTTP status codes.
