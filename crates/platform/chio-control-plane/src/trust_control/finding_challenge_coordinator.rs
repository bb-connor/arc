//! Single-operator coordinator for the finding challenge and audit lane.
//!
//! Adjudication is not this module's job. The pure evaluator decides a
//! verdict from artifacts alone, and the slash module computes every
//! amount that moves. What is left is everything those two cannot do
//! without a clock or a database: authenticating a filing, charging the
//! dispute fee exactly once, locking and disposing the buyer's bond,
//! linearizing the upheld transaction against the purchase line, sealing
//! the claim accounting, running the appeal, fencing every external
//! effect before it is dispatched, and driving the liability head through
//! its compare-and-set lifecycle. This coordinator owns exactly that, and
//! it never re-implements the two it delegates to.
//!
//! Five entry points, each fenced by durable state rather than by call
//! order:
//!
//! - [`FindingChallengeCoordinator::submit`] authenticates the signed
//!   challenge, records it, and, for a buyer submission only, charges the
//!   dispute fee to the admission-pinned challenge-administration pool and
//!   locks the dispute bond. A venue audit charges nothing and locks
//!   nothing; the closed authorization union makes a fee or bond field on
//!   that branch unrepresentable rather than merely refused.
//! - [`FindingChallengeCoordinator::evaluate`] admits the evaluation,
//!   calls the pure evaluator, signs the outcome under the evaluator role,
//!   records the verdict, and disposes the bond. `Indeterminate` never
//!   forfeits, and a closed retry window returns the lock exactly once
//!   without charging a second fee.
//! - [`FindingChallengeCoordinator::uphold`] runs the critical
//!   transaction: the liability compare-and-set, the sales block, the
//!   purchase-cutoff freeze, and the seller-signed claim deadline commit
//!   together, then the pre-cutoff slots must close and that deadline must
//!   elapse before the claim snapshot is computed and sealed, then the
//!   pending-appeal sanction and hold are minted and evaluated.
//! - [`FindingChallengeCoordinator::resolve_appeal`] reverses a timely
//!   successful appeal, or, on appeal finality with no reversal, signs the
//!   enforcement instruction and fences every domain-keyed effect intent
//!   before the liability enters finalizing. An unresolved appeal
//!   quarantines; it is never read as a denial.
//! - [`FindingChallengeCoordinator::finalize`] verifies the enforcement
//!   pair through the settlement choke point, re-reads the chain state the
//!   signed snapshot rests on, plans the impairment, dispatches it through
//!   the injected publisher, and settles only on a confirmed
//!   reconciliation the chain still qualifies.
//!
//! Compiled only under the `cognition-market-experimental` feature.
