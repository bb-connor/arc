#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Firecracker-isolated execution for hosted cognition-market jobs.
//!
//! The worker stages immutable, digest-pinned guest assets into a unique jail,
//! starts Firecracker only through its jailer, and exchanges bounded canonical
//! JSON frames over virtio-vsock. The digest-pinned guest supervisor owns the
//! vsock endpoint and runs the untrusted workload in an in-guest cgroup with a
//! hard file-descriptor limit. No guest network interface is configured.
