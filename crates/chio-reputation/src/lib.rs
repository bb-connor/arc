//! chio-reputation: deterministic local reputation scoring for Chio agents.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally pure and storage-agnostic. It scores an agent
//! from a caller-provided local corpus assembled from persisted receipts,
//! capability-lineage snapshots, and budget-usage records. It does not depend
//! on `chio-kernel`, which keeps the scoring model reusable and avoids a future
//! dependency cycle when kernel-side issuance hooks begin consuming it.
