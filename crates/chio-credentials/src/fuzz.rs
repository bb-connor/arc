//! libFuzzer entry-point module.
//!
//! Authored under M02.P1.T1.a (`.planning/trajectory/02-fuzzing-post-pr13.md`
//! Phase 1). This module is gated behind the `fuzz` Cargo feature so it only
//! compiles into the standalone `chio-fuzz` workspace at `../../fuzz`. The
//! production build of `chio-credentials` never pulls in `arbitrary`, never
//! exposes these symbols, and never gets recompiled with libFuzzer
//! instrumentation.
//!
//! The single entry point [`fuzz_jwt_vc_verify`] consumes arbitrary bytes
//! and drives them through [`crate::verify_chio_passport_jwt_vc_json`], the
//! Chio-flavoured JWT-VC trust boundary. The verifier is fail-closed by
//! construction (every invalid input must surface as
//! `Err(CredentialError::*)`, never a panic), so this fuzz target exists to
//! catch parse-path regressions in the compact-JWT decoder, base64url path,
//! `serde_json` decoder, and downstream schema-shape checks.
//!
//! The issuer keypair is fixed via [`Keypair::from_seed`] with a constant
//! 32-byte seed, wrapped in a [`OnceLock`] so the keypair is materialised
//! once per fuzzer process. Varying the issuer key across iterations would
//! mask parse-path failures behind signature-mismatch errors that the
//! verifier reports before reaching the body of the JWT-VC schema check.
