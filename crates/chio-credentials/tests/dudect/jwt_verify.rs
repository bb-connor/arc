//! Timing-leak dudect harness for JWT VC signature verification.
//!
//! Source-doc anchor: `.planning/trajectory/02-fuzzing-post-pr13.md`
//! Phase 3 atomic task P3.T5 + the "Timing-leak (dudect) harness" section.
//!
//! Gated behind the `dudect` Cargo feature so default `cargo test -p
//! chio-credentials` is unaffected; opt in via:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test -p chio-credentials --features dudect --release jwt_verify
//! ```
//!
//! # What this harness measures
//!
//! Two input classes are pushed through
//! [`chio_credentials::verify_chio_passport_jwt_vc_json`]:
//!
//! - `Class::Left`: an all-zero compact byte string. The compact-JWT decoder
//!   rejects this in the very first base64url segment split, so the rejection
//!   path is short.
//! - `Class::Right`: a random ASCII byte string of the same length. Same
//!   fail-closed verdict (no arbitrary byte stream can pass the issuer
//!   signature check), but the parse path may take a different number of
//!   base64url-decode iterations or `serde_json` calls before the fail.
//!
//! Both inputs are wrong, both fail-closed; what the harness asks is whether
//! the failure path is constant-time with respect to the input contents. If
//! the runtime distributions of Left and Right are statistically
//! distinguishable (Welch's t > 4.5 in two consecutive runs), the verifier
//! has a data-dependent timing leak that an off-path attacker could exploit
//! to learn something about why a candidate JWT was rejected.
//!
//! The CI lane `.github/workflows/dudect.yml` (M02.P2.T4) wires this
//! harness into nightly + PR-time runs with the two-consecutive-runs
//! `t < 4.5` pass rule.
