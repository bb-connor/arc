//! Lane c: cross-operator fan-out over iroh-gossip per-treaty topics.
//!
//! ADAPTER-SPEC section 4 row (c) + 4.1. This is the one genuinely many-to-many
//! surface (reputation clearing, transit-hub re-gossip). It carries
//! [`PheromoneDepositGossip`] frames over an iroh-gossip swarm, one swarm per
//! treaty.
//!
//! ## Topic derivation (one-topic-per-treaty gives ROUTING separation)
//!
//! `TopicId = blake3("chio-pheromone-gossip/v1\x00" || treaty_id_bytes)`, where
//! `treaty_id_bytes` is the canonical UTF-8 of the existing `String` treaty id
//! (ADAPTER-SPEC 4.1). A gossip topic is one swarm where every member sees every
//! other member's wire traffic. Binding `TopicId` one-to-one to a treaty means
//! each treaty's traffic rides its OWN swarm: this is ROUTING separation
//! (different treaty, different swarm, different `TopicId`), which keeps one
//! treaty's frames off another treaty's wire by default.
//!
//! Topic-per-treaty ROUTING separation is one layer; ACCESS CONTROL is the other
//! and is now ENFORCED (below). The `TopicId` is deterministic and therefore NOT a
//! secret; it grants no access on its own. The accept-time
//! [`DirectoryGate`](crate::admission::DirectoryGate) is FEDERATION-GLOBAL: it
//! admits an operator to the federation, not to a specific treaty. So a
//! globally-admitted operator that is NOT a party to a treaty could still compute
//! that treaty's (non-secret) `TopicId`. That gap is closed by a PER-TREATY
//! membership gate layered on top of federation admission.
//!
//! ## Treaty-party membership gate (federation admission + treaty party set)
//!
//! Membership is sourced from the SAME issuer-signed, anti-rollback substrate the
//! transport keys use: the per-treaty PARTY SET carried in the
//! [`VerifiedDirectory`](crate::identity::VerifiedDirectory) (an issuer-signed
//! `treaty_id -> {party kernel_ids}` map, body-hash-pinned, validity-windowed,
//! monotone-versioned). The gate is enforced FAIL-CLOSED in two places (defense in
//! depth), so this is no longer routing separation alone but enforced
//! treaty-scoped access control:
//!
//! 1. JOIN side: [`FanoutLane::subscribe_treaty`] /
//!    [`subscribe_treaty_with_timeout`](FanoutLane::subscribe_treaty_with_timeout)
//!    reject with [`FanoutError::TreatyMembershipDenied`] BEFORE joining the swarm
//!    if the LOCAL operator is not a party to `treaty_id`. The local operator's
//!    kernel id is resolved from the node's OWN AUTHENTICATED endpoint identity (the
//!    `EndpointId` the swarm authenticates as on the wire), NOT from a
//!    caller-supplied string, so a non-party cannot pass a real party's kernel id to
//!    slip past the gate.
//! 2. RECEIVE side: the frame-verification path
//!    ([`verify_fanout_frame`] / [`FanoutTopic::recv_verified`]) additionally
//!    rejects (same variant) a frame whose ORIGIN kernel is not a party to the
//!    frame's `treaty_id`, so a non-party that joins the swarm anyway cannot inject
//!    an accepted frame.
//!
//! The DELIVERED guarantee is therefore: (1) routing separation (above), (2) the
//! treaty-party membership gate at JOIN and RECEIVE (this section), and (3) a
//! receive-side swarm/treaty binding, so a frame carrying a foreign `treaty_id` is
//! rejected on this swarm even if its deposit self-signature is valid (see
//! [`FanoutTopic::recv_verified`] and [`FanoutError::TreatyMismatch`]). This is
//! federation admission AND treaty-party membership, not one standing in for the
//! other.
//!
//! ## Residual exposure: inbound gossip joins are NOT gated at admission (iroh_gossip 0.101)
//!
//! The JOIN-side gate above guards THIS node's OWN subscription: it stops a local
//! non-party from calling [`FanoutLane::subscribe_treaty`] and joining a swarm it is
//! not a party to. It does NOT gate INBOUND joins by OTHER peers. A custom client
//! that BYPASSES the local helper (dials a party's endpoint directly and computes
//! the deterministic, non-secret `TopicId`) can still be admitted as a gossip
//! neighbor and PASSIVELY OBSERVE frames the honest swarm members forward. This is a
//! CONFIDENTIALITY residual, and it is NOT closed here because iroh_gossip 0.101
//! exposes no inbound-admission hook. Verified against iroh-gossip 0.101:
//!
//! - The membership protocol admits inbound joins UNCONDITIONALLY:
//!   `hyparview::HyparView::on_join` adds the joining peer with `Priority::High`, and
//!   `add_active` ALWAYS succeeds for a high-priority join (evicting a random slot if
//!   full). There is no application predicate consulted.
//! - `JoinOptions` (the only per-subscription config) carries just `bootstrap` and
//!   `subscription_capacity`: no per-peer/per-topic admission callback or ACL.
//! - There is no pre-acceptance event: `iroh_gossip::api::Event` is only
//!   `NeighborUp` / `NeighborDown` / `Received` / `Lagged`; `NeighborUp` fires AFTER
//!   the peer is already in the active view, and a neighbor cannot be rejected then.
//! - The mounted `ProtocolHandler::accept` for `iroh_gossip::ALPN` admits ALL
//!   connections; the federation-wide accept-time
//!   [`DirectoryGate`](crate::admission::DirectoryGate) is the only connection-level
//!   filter, and it is per-FEDERATION not per-TREATY (one gossip connection
//!   multiplexes every topic, so it cannot be gated per treaty at the connection
//!   layer either).
//!
//! What IS enforced despite this: a bypassing joiner cannot INJECT an accepted frame
//! (the RECEIVE-side treaty-party gate drops a non-party origin, and the
//! swarm/treaty binding drops a foreign-treaty frame), and topic-per-treaty routing
//! separation keeps other treaties' traffic off this swarm. What is NOT enforceable
//! with this gossip version is preventing a federation-admitted non-party from
//! JOINING a treaty swarm and OBSERVING its forwarded traffic. Closing that requires
//! an upstream iroh_gossip capability this lane would then gate on treaty membership:
//! a per-topic/per-peer inbound admission predicate in `JoinOptions`, or a
//! pre-acceptance `NeighborJoinRequested` event with the ability to deny the join.
//! Until then treaty confidentiality against a passive federation-admitted observer
//! rests on federation admission plus routing separation, not join-time treaty
//! enforcement. This is a documented API limitation, NOT a closed gap.
//!
//! ## The load-bearing correctness property: `delivered_from` is NOT the author
//!
//! In gossip, [`Message::delivered_from`](iroh_gossip::api::Message) is the
//! forwarding NEIGHBOR that relayed the frame, NOT the original author
//! (empirically observed: node C reports `delivered_from = B` for a message A
//! authored, ADAPTER-SPEC 4 row (c)). Therefore this lane MUST NOT reuse the
//! `authenticated_sender == author` equality the direct lanes (a/b) rely on, and
//! MUST NOT call
//! [`verify_pheromone_gossip_frame_for_batch`](chio_federation::pheromone_gossip)
//! (which would demand `gossiping_peer_kernel_id == authenticated_sender`, false
//! over any relay hop).
//!
//! Instead, every received payload is origin-verified FROM THE PAYLOAD ALONE:
//! 1. the transport-independent
//!    [`verify_pheromone_gossip_frame`] (namespace, policy liveness, origin ==
//!    deposit author, transit-chain integrity), and
//! 2. the embedded deposit's OWN self-signature, verified against the origin
//!    operator's passport key resolved from a trusted directory (NEVER from
//!    `delivered_from`).
//!
//! Neither step consults the transport sender. `delivered_from` is never an input
//! to verification (see [`verify_fanout_frame`] and
//! [`decode_and_verify_fanout_frame`], whose signatures do not even accept it).
