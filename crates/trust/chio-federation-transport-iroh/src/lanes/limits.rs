//! Shared accept-side hardening for the three DIRECT custom lanes (pheromone,
//! revocation, bilateral).
//!
//! ADR-0014 production-robustness: an admission-gated but hostile peer must not
//! be able to hang a handler task (slowloris) or spawn unbounded accept tasks
//! (resource exhaustion). Each direct-lane `ProtocolHandler::accept` runs on a
//! freshly spawned tokio task and awaits peer-controlled progress at four points:
//! opening the bidi stream (`accept_bi`), reading the length-delimited request
//! frame (the biggest slowloris surface: a large declared length then a dribble
//! of bytes), writing the response, and lingering on `conn.closed()` so the
//! finished stream is not reset before the dialer reads it. Every one of those
//! is bounded here, and the number of concurrently admitted handlers is capped.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed, never trust-bypassing
//!
//! These bounds ONLY limit how long the handler waits and how many peers it
//! serves at once. A timeout drops / resets the connection; it never accepts,
//! short-circuits, or weakens verification. The trust verdict is produced by the
//! per-frame verifier ABOVE the transport and is unaffected: a bounded exchange
//! either runs the full verification or resets with no verdict at all.
//!
//! ## What this module deliberately does NOT set
//!
//! The QUIC `Endpoint::max_idle_timeout` is a transport-level backstop owned by
//! the WIRING (Phase 4), not by this crate. It should sit comfortably above the
//! app-level [`AcceptLimitConfig::linger_timeout`] so a legitimately slow but
//! live exchange is not killed underneath these bounds. See
//! [`RECOMMENDED_MAX_IDLE_TIMEOUT`] for the value the wiring can consume.
