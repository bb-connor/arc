// The `PLAY_INTEGRITY_PINNED_X_B64` / `PLAY_INTEGRITY_PINNED_Y_B64` coordinates
// and the `GOOGLE_PLAY_INTEGRITY_ROOT_KID` ("chio-play-integrity-fixture-root")
// below are a *** SYNTHETIC FIXTURE KEY ***, NOT Google's real Play Integrity
// verification key. They are byte-identical to the development/test signer, and
// the matching PRIVATE KEY is committed in this very file
// (`PLAY_INTEGRITY_FIXTURE_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`). Because the production verification
// path pins exactly this key set, a binary built today would "trust" a key whose
// private half lives in version control — i.e. anyone with repo access could mint
// Play Integrity tokens the verifier accepts.
//
// BEFORE ANY PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (tracked by BAC-601):
//   1. REPLACE the pinned coordinates + kid below with Google's real Play
//      Integrity public verification keys (rotate `GOOGLE_PLAY_INTEGRITY_ROOT_KID`
//      off the `*-fixture-root` placeholder value).
//   2. REMOVE / ROTATE the committed fixture private key — it must never coexist
//      with a real pinned root, and the fixture signer must stay test/dev-only.
//   3. The [`assert_play_integrity_root_is_production_ready`] runtime guard below
//      MUST pass (it fails loudly while the placeholder kid is still pinned).
//      Production startup paths MUST call it; see that fn's docs for why this is a
//      runtime guard and not a `compile_error!`.
//
// A `#[cfg(not(any(test, feature = "dev-fixtures")))] compile_error!(...)` was
// deliberately NOT used here: the default-feature (prod) build legitimately needs
// to compile today (CI builds `chio-custody-hw` with default features), and the
// crate is consumed by other workspace members that must keep compiling while the
// real key is being provisioned under BAC-601. Hard-failing the build would break
// that. Instead we fail *loudly at startup* via the guard below, which is gated so
// it is hard to ship the fixture key into prod silently while leaving the build
// (and the test/dev-fixtures path) working.
