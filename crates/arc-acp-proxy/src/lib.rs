//! # arc-acp-proxy
//!
//! Security proxy for the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Sits between an
//! editor/IDE client and an ACP coding agent, intercepting JSON-RPC
//! messages to enforce ARC capability-based access control.
//!
//! The proxy:
//!
//! 1. Spawns the ACP agent as a subprocess with stdio transport.
//! 2. Forwards JSON-RPC messages bidirectionally (client <-> agent).
//! 3. Intercepts `session/request_permission` to enforce capability tokens.
//! 4. Intercepts `fs/read_text_file` and `fs/write_text_file` to validate
//!    path-scoped capabilities.
//! 5. Intercepts `terminal/create` to run command guards.
//! 6. Generates unsigned audit entries for all `tool_call` events observed
//!    in `session/update` notifications. These can be promoted to signed
//!    ARC receipts by a downstream component with key material.
