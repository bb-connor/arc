//! Phase 19.1 -- compliance scoring on top of `ComplianceReport`.
//!
//! Productizes the existing [`crate::operator_report::ComplianceReport`]
//! into a user-facing 0..=1000 score with weighted factors:
//!
//! | Factor                   | Max points | Signal                                   |
//! |--------------------------|-----------:|------------------------------------------|
//! | Deny rate                |        300 | denies / total_observed                  |
//! | Revocation rate          |        300 | revoked_caps / observed_caps (or flag)   |
//! | Velocity anomaly rate    |        150 | anomaly_windows / total_windows          |
//! | Policy coverage          |        150 | lineage + checkpoint rates (averaged)    |
//! | Attestation freshness    |        100 | age of latest attestation vs. staleness  |
//!
//! Weights sum to 1000. Each factor produces a 0..=max deduction; the
//! final score is `1000 - total_deductions`, clamped to `[0, 1000]`.
//!
//! This module is additive: it consumes a [`ComplianceReport`] without
//! modifying its fields. Callers who already materialize a compliance
//! report reuse its figures verbatim.
