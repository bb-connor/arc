//! Mpsc-backed receipt signing task (M05.P1.T3).
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Pre-T3 the kernel signed receipts inline on the evaluate critical path,
//! holding the synchronous `build_and_sign_receipt` step inside the same
//! call stack that was already running guard pipelines, store mutations,
//! and (eventually) tool dispatch. Under load that funnel pinned a worker
//! thread per concurrent evaluate call.
//!
//! T3 introduces a single signing task that owns a clone of the kernel
//! signing keypair and pulls signing requests from a bounded
//! [`tokio::sync::mpsc`] channel. Producers `.await` on a oneshot reply
//! channel rather than on a mutex; backpressure surfaces naturally when
//! the bounded queue fills.
//!
//! ## Boundaries (what T3 does NOT do)
//!
//! - T3 does NOT remove the existing synchronous `build_and_sign_receipt`
//!   helper in `kernel/responses.rs`. Internal call sites (deny-receipt
//!   builders, child-receipt builders, federation cosign hook) keep their
//!   inline path until later phase work routes them through the channel.
//! - T3 does NOT change receipt body construction, tenant-scope handling,
//!   or the canonical-JSON signing pipeline. The mpsc path delegates to
//!   the same `chio_kernel_core::sign_receipt` portable helper that the
//!   sync path uses, so receipt bytes are byte-identical across the two.
//! - T3 does NOT touch the receipt-store append path. Persistence stays
//!   inline; only the signature step crosses the channel.
//!
//! ## Crash recovery contract
//!
//! Per the milestone doc, full crash-recovery integration tests land in
//! M05.P4.T4 (`tests/signer_crash.rs`). T3 lays the channel and handle
//! shape so that test harness has something to reach into; this module
//! only guarantees:
//!
//! - The signing task runs until the last [`SigningTaskHandle`] sender
//!   is dropped, at which point the channel closes and the task returns.
//! - [`SigningTaskHandle::shutdown`] drains every in-flight request that
//!   reached the channel before returning, so callers that successfully
//!   `.send().await`-ed get a reply (or an error) before shutdown
//!   completes.
//! - Producers whose oneshot reply receiver is dropped (e.g. the caller
//!   timed out waiting) do not poison the task; the signed receipt is
//!   simply discarded.
//!
//! ## Channel capacity
//!
//! Default capacity is [`DEFAULT_SIGNING_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`] (256). The
//! milestone names "fail-closed default" -- a bounded channel where
//! producers `.await` on `send` until capacity frees up, rather than an
//! unbounded queue that lets memory grow without limit. Tests can pick a
//! smaller capacity to exercise backpressure deterministically via
//! [`SigningTaskHandle::with_capacity`].
