# arc-policy

`arc-policy` is ARC's HushSpec policy layer. It parses, validates, merges,
evaluates, and compiles policy documents into the runtime guard and constraint
surface used by the supported stack.

Use this crate when you are working on policy authoring, validation, or runtime
compilation instead of the lower-level guard implementations directly.
