# Lambda Deployment-Shape Verdict Matrix Driver

This Rust crate is the Lambda deployment-shape driver for the Chio verdict
matrix. It is registered in
`crates/chio-conformance/verdict_matrix/manifest.toml` as
`lambda-deployment-shape` with `status = "prepared"` and
`matrix_role = "deployment-shape"`. The
`sdks/lambda/chio-lambda-extension` runtime provides the host kernel
bindings the driver invokes through a local-invoke shim.

## Contract

The driver loads the canonical scenario corpus from
`crates/chio-conformance/verdict_matrix/scenarios/` and emits a JSON report
on stdout shaped as `(verdict, reason_code, scope_set)` per scenario. The
`verdict_matrix.deployment_shape_smoke` integration test in
`crates/chio-conformance` is the cross-deployment smoke gate that asserts
the Lambda driver is registered, scaffolded, and returns the same verdict
tuples as the Rust kernel reference for the canonical scenario subset.

## Sidecar wiring

The driver mirrors the `typescript-node-http` driver contract:
the Lambda extension does not embed kernel evaluation. Active execution
against a live Chio sidecar is operator-supplied via the
`CHIO_VERDICT_MATRIX_SIDECAR_URL` environment variable (or the
`CHIO_SIDECAR_URL` fallback). When the variable is absent, every scenario
is reported as `unsupported` with a diagnostic that names the missing
variable.

## Run

```bash
cargo test -p chio-verdict-matrix-driver-lambda --quiet
cargo run -p chio-verdict-matrix-driver-lambda --quiet
```

## D07 closure

This driver is one of four deployment-shape SDK drivers (JVM, dotnet,
Lambda, k8s) that close the M02 D07 deferral. The combined registration is
audited under "M07 P6 closure".
