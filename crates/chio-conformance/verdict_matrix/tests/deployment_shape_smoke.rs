//! Cross-deployment integration smoke gate for the four deployment-shape
//! SDK drivers (JVM, dotnet, Lambda, k8s).
//!
//! The deployment shapes re-host one of the primary kernels (Rust,
//! Python, TS node-http, WASM browser, Go) but expose distinct wire
//! surfaces. This test asserts:
//!
//! 1. The verdict-matrix manifest registers each deployment-shape
//!    driver with `status = "prepared"`, `matrix_role = "deployment-shape"`,
//!    `underlying_driver = "rust-kernel"`, and a stable wire-shape label
//!    (`driver = "jvm"|"dotnet"|"lambda"|"k8s"`).
//! 2. The driver scaffolds exist on disk under
//!    `crates/chio-conformance/verdict_matrix/drivers/{jvm,dotnet,lambda,k8s}/`
//!    with the expected entry points and READMEs.
//! 3. Each scaffolded driver normalizes to the same Rust-kernel verdict
//!    tuple on the canonical scenario subset, asserting the deployment
//!    shapes inherit the kernel verdict tuple by construction. The actual
//!    sidecar wiring is operator-tactical; the smoke gate asserts the
//!    deployment-shape registration shape and the verdict-tuple equality
//!    contract that the four drivers will inherit from the Rust kernel
//!    reference once the wiring lands.
