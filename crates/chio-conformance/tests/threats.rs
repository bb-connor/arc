//! Owner: M05.P5.T3.

//! Each `mod` declaration below names a threat ID whose test body has
//! been populated. The stub files `tests/threats/<id>.rs` for threat
//! IDs that are not yet covered remain on disk with `unimplemented!()`
//! bodies (see M05.P5.T2) but are intentionally NOT pulled into this
//! integration test, so they neither compile nor run until a follow-up
//! ticket fills the body in. The threat-model-coverage CI gate
//! (M05.P5.T4) inspects the on-disk file set for `unimplemented!`
//! markers to decide which threat IDs still need tests.
//!
//! Covered threat IDs cited in the M05 success criteria and M05.P4
