# chio-anthropic-tools-adapter

Provider-native adapter that translates Anthropic Messages API tool-use
traffic into Chio's provider-agnostic fabric. Implements the
[`chio-tool-call-fabric`](../chio-tool-call-fabric/) `ProviderAdapter`
trait so a single Chio policy file enforces uniformly across OpenAI
Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Bedrock Converse.

## Transport

The adapter is a mediation gateway, not a validate-only shim. It forwards a
native `messages.create` request to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
over the shared `chio-provider-adapter-core` HTTP transport and lifts the
`tool_use` content blocks out of the response. The caller supplies the verdict
between lift and lower; this crate has no direct kernel dependency.

- `AnthropicAdapter::send_messages` posts a batch request and lifts the
  response.
- `AnthropicAdapter::send_messages_stream` posts a streaming request and runs
  the SSE gate over the buffered `text/event-stream` body.
- Outbound requests carry `x-api-key: <key>` plus the pinned
  `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` header (and `anthropic-beta:
  computer-use-2025-01-24` when the `computer-use` feature is on).

The API key is injected by the caller through `anthropic_transport(api_key)` or
read from the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable through
`anthropic_transport_from_env()` (which fails closed when the variable is unset
or empty). Unit tests use the in-memory `MockTransport`, which records calls and
returns scripted responses without touching the network, so the test suite stays
offline and deterministic.

## Pinned upstream API

- `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` (verbatim header value).
- Exposed in code as `chio_anthropic_tools_adapter::transport::ANTHROPIC_VERSION`.
- Recorded in `Cargo.toml` under `[package.metadata.chio]`.

Bumping the pin is a deliberate PR with a fixture re-record; CI never
auto-bumps.

## Public API

- `AnthropicAdapter` owns batch and streaming lift/lower entrypoints.
- `AnthropicAdapterConfig::new` pins `api_version` to `ANTHROPIC_VERSION`.
- `ProviderAdapter` and `Provider` implementations expose fabric translation
  and provider identity.
- `AnthropicServerToolGate` enforces the feature plus manifest dual gate.
- `ToolUseBlock`, `ToolResultBlock`, `GatedSseStream`, and the transport
  constructors expose the native wire and HTTP boundary.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use chio_anthropic_tools_adapter::{
    anthropic_transport_from_env, AnthropicAdapter, AnthropicAdapterConfig,
};

let config = AnthropicAdapterConfig::new(
    "anthropic-1", "Anthropic Messages", "0.1.0", public_key_hex, "wks_prod",
);
let transport = anthropic_transport_from_env()?;
let adapter = AnthropicAdapter::new(config, Arc::new(transport));
let invocations = adapter.send_messages(request_body).await?;
```

## Cargo features

| Feature        | Default | Effect                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `computer-use` | off     | Compiles the Anthropic server-tool variants (`computer_use_20241022`, `bash_20241022`, `text_editor_20241022`) and lets the transport stamp `anthropic-beta: computer-use-2025-01-24` on outgoing requests. |

The `computer-use` feature alone is not sufficient to enable the
server-tool surface at runtime. The adapter requires a `chio-manifest`
`server_tools: [...]` allowlist at lift time through
`AnthropicAdapter::new_with_registry`. Default deny applies even with the
feature on, including when `AnthropicAdapter::new` is used without a verified manifest
wiring.

## Server-tool manifest gate

Anthropic server tools are provider-hosted beta surfaces. Chio treats them as
separate from regular client-hosted tools and fails closed unless both gates
are open:

1. Build the crate with `--features computer-use`.
2. Include the matching stable entry in the manifest `server_tools` allowlist:

```json
{
  "server_tools": ["computer_use", "bash", "text_editor"]
}
```

The adapter maps Anthropic's versioned wire-name families to the stable
manifest entries. Date suffixes remain provider wire detail; the feature gate
and manifest gate classify the whole family, not only the examples below:

| Anthropic wire name        | Manifest entry |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| `computer_use_20241022`    | `computer_use` |
| `bash_20241022`            | `bash`         |
| `text_editor_20241022`     | `text_editor`  |

Unlisted server tools return a `ProviderError::Malformed` before the
`ToolInvocation` crosses the Chio trust boundary. Regular custom tools are
not affected by `server_tools` and continue through the normal capability and
guard path.

Allowlisting a stable server-tool family does not authorize arbitrary input
shapes from a future provider revision. Before kernel execution,
`chio-manifest` validates the invocation against Chio's pinned trusted schema
catalog for the `computer_use`, `bash`, or `text_editor` family. A date-suffix
revision remains classified under the same allowlist entry, but incompatible
new actions or fields fail closed until the trusted catalog is reviewed and
updated.

This differs from Bedrock Converse. Bedrock tool use is client-defined via
`toolConfig`; it does not have an Anthropic-managed `bash` server tool, so
Bedrock bash-like behavior is modeled as a normal customer tool and remains
outside this allowlist.

## Adapter-visible error taxonomy

Anthropic documents HTTP errors as JSON envelopes with a top-level
`error.type` and `error.message`, plus a `request_id`; streaming can also
surface an `error` event after a 200 response. Rows marked `HTTP transport
boundary` are mapped from the upstream HTTP status by
`chio_provider_adapter_core::http::map_transport_error` when `send_messages`
runs. Rows marked `current adapter path` are emitted by the lift/lower,
streaming, or evaluator path.

The table is parsed by `tests/error_taxonomy_doctest.rs`; keep each envelope
as one valid inline JSON object.

| ProviderError class | Native or boundary envelope | Source | Adapter-visible behavior |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |

Surface provider refusal as content-policy denial rather than a tool execution error. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::BadToolArgs` | `{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_bad_args","name":"get_weather","input":"not an object"}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:anthropic` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-ANTHROPIC`) + current adapter path | Anthropic provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Fail closed when Anthropic emits a `tool_use.input` that cannot become canonical JSON object arguments. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::Upstream5xx` | `{"status":529,"body":{"type":"error","error":{"type":"overloaded_error","message":"overloaded"},"request_id":"req_overloaded"}}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:anthropic` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-ANTHROPIC`) + HTTP transport boundary | Anthropic provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Keep upstream 5xx and overload bodies visible for retry and audit policy. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::TransportTimeout` | `{"transport":"timeout","endpoint":"https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages","elapsed_ms":30000}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:anthropic` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-ANTHROPIC`) + HTTP transport boundary | Anthropic provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Classify local transport timeout separately from Anthropic 504 `timeout_error` envelopes. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |

Preserve the fabric verdict-budget error when the evaluator misses the 250ms gate. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::Malformed` | `{"event":"content_block_delta","data":{"type":"content_block_delta","index":0,"delta":{"type":"input_json_delta","partial_json":"{}"}}}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:anthropic` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-ANTHROPIC`) + current adapter path | Anthropic provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Fail closed for impossible or out-of-order native SSE/message shapes. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |

`ProviderError::Other` is intentionally absent. Native Anthropic envelopes
must map to a concrete class above, or fail closed as `Malformed` when the
shape cannot be trusted.

## Crate layout

```text
crates/protocol/chio-anthropic-tools-adapter/
  Cargo.toml         pin metadata, computer-use feature, workspace lints
  README.md          this file
  src/
    lib.rs           AnthropicAdapter, send_messages, AnthropicAdapterConfig, error type
    manifest.rs      manifest-derived server-tool allowlist gate
    transport.rs     HttpTransport builders, MockTransport, ANTHROPIC_VERSION pin
    native.rs        ToolUseBlock, ToolResultBlock, server-tool variants
```

Batch `lift`/`lower` lives in `src/adapter.rs`, and SSE state-machine wiring
lives in `src/streaming.rs`.

## Building

```bash
cargo build -p chio-anthropic-tools-adapter
cargo build -p chio-anthropic-tools-adapter --features computer-use
cargo test -p chio-anthropic-tools-adapter --features computer-use server_tools
```

Both invocations must succeed in CI.

## House rules

- No em dashes (U+2014) anywhere in code, comments, or documentation.
- Workspace clippy lints `unwrap_used = "deny"` and `expect_used = "deny"`
  apply; no exceptions.
- Fail-closed: server-tool requests without the `computer-use` feature
  surface a structured error rather than silently downgrading.
