# chio-cross-protocol Architecture Notes

## Module Boundaries

`lib.rs` declares the public cross-protocol modules and does not flatten their
APIs at the crate root.

- `discovery.rs`: target protocol enum, parser, display implementation, schema
  target-protocol lookup, and `TargetProtocolRegistry`.
- `lifecycle.rs`: runtime lifecycle surfaces and metadata contracts.
- `semantic_hints.rs`: bridge fidelity and tool semantic-hint extraction.
- `routing.rs`: route availability, candidate evidence, route-selection
  evidence, planner decisions, and route metadata.
- `execution.rs`: kernel-bound execution request, target request/response
  handoff, target executor trait, and OpenAI-shaped target executor.
- `capability_bridge.rs`: capability references, capability envelopes, protocol
  trace data, bridge trait, and attenuation/hash helpers.
- `orchestrator.rs`: shared orchestration runtime and signed metadata assembly.
- `validation.rs`: request-boundary validation and schema extension helpers.
- `error.rs`: cross-protocol bridge error type.

The crate is intentionally a shared substrate for protocol edge crates rather
than a product surface. Callers import the owning module for each domain instead
of relying on root-level aliases.

## Orchestrator Boundary Validation

The orchestrator builds signed receipt metadata from request identity fields and
caller-provided capability references. An orchestrator-owned validation step runs
before capability reference injection, route planning, trace construction,
target execution, or receipt signing, turning lineage data from trusted caller
metadata into a checked shared invariant:

- `origin_request_id`, `kernel_request_id`, `target_server_id`,
  `target_tool_name`, and `agent_id` must be non-empty, unpadded, and
  control-free. Values are not trimmed, because signed lineage must describe
  exactly what the caller submitted. `origin_request_id` becomes the source hop
  id and bridge id suffix; the others cross from protocol edges into native
  kernel execution.
- A supplied `CrossProtocolCapabilityRef` must match the active capability id,
  the deterministic parent capability hash, and the `CapabilityBridge`
  `source_protocol`. A request entering through one protocol cannot carry a
  capability reference whose `originProtocol` belongs to another, even when its
  id and parent hash are otherwise valid; protocol-edge metadata is not trusted
  when it disagrees with the bridge object the caller selected.
- When both an authenticated session and an authoritative security context are
  supplied, their session ids must match exactly before route planning. Native,
  OpenAI, and MCP target execution pass that authenticated session into the
  kernel's session-aware manifest-security entrypoint.

Malformed requests fail closed with `BridgeError::InvalidRequest` at the shared
orchestrator boundary rather than reaching route planning or kernel execution.

## Security and API Constraints

The orchestrator fails closed before signing or forwarding misleading lineage.
Route selection evidence, trace ids, receipt metadata, and capability envelope
fields stay canonical and byte-stable for valid requests. Public type names,
trait methods, and serialized field names stay source-compatible.
`CrossProtocolExecutionRequest` adds the Rust-only
`authenticated_session_id` field. Native and registered target execution
continues to route through the kernel.

## Affected Dependents

`chio-a2a-edge` and `chio-acp-edge` populate the authenticated session.
Sessionless compatibility callers, including `chio-acp-proxy` and existing MCP
tests, explicitly use `None`. Malformed requests change from kernel/routing
behavior to `BridgeError::InvalidRequest`.

## Verification Focus

Tests cover identity-field and authenticated-session rejection before route planning, capability id and
parent-hash mismatch rejection, source-protocol drift rejection, metadata byte
stability for valid bridge requests, and kernel handoff parity for native and
registered executors. Edge-crate smoke tests prove that A2A, ACP, MCP, and
OpenAPI callers inherit the shared orchestrator boundary without reimplementing
lineage validation.
