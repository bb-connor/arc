# chio-wall Architecture

`chio-wall` owns the Chio-Wall companion-product CLI. It is the file and command
orchestration layer over `chio-wall-core`, Chio guard evaluation, receipt
creation, SQLite-backed evidence export, and validation-package rendering.

## Boundaries

- `src/main.rs` owns the clap command surface and keeps routing thin.
- `src/commands.rs` owns control-path export, validation-package generation,
  temporary receipt database creation, Chio evidence export, and operator output.
- `chio-wall-core` owns typed package contracts and schema-level validation.
  This CLI should call those validators instead of duplicating schema rules.
- `docs/chio-wall/*` defines the bounded product claim, required output layout,
  fail-closed operations, and deferred scope.

## Pain Points

- The export path validates in-memory objects before writing them, but the CLI
  reports success without reading the completed package back from disk.
- The operations runbook says the package is incomplete if files are missing,
  inconsistent, or unresolved. That is a wrapper-owned invariant because only
  the CLI sees the final file layout and Chio evidence directory.
- `commands.rs` is large because it currently mixes object construction,
  evidence export, file writes, output summaries, and tests in one module.

## Security And API Constraints

- Preserve the current CLI surface: `control-path export`, `control-path
  validate`, `--output`, and global `--json`.
- Preserve the bounded Chio-Wall product lane: one buyer motion, one control
  surface, one research-to-execution denied access event, and one evidence
  package.
- Fail closed if generated package files, references, owners, workflow IDs,
  policy bindings, denied-access records, or Chio evidence directories are
  missing or inconsistent.
- Do not move Chio evidence export semantics into `chio-wall-core`; the CLI owns
  file-system reconciliation while the core crate owns typed contracts.

## Affected Dependents

- `crates/chio-wall-core` remains the source of typed contract validation.
- CLI tests under `crates/chio-wall/tests` exercise exported on-disk packages.
- Documentation under `docs/chio-wall` is the source of truth for output layout
  and fail-closed operating expectations.

## Planned Improvement

Add a post-write reconciliation boundary to `export_control_path`: after the
CLI writes the control-path package and Chio evidence export, read the package
back from disk, validate the typed contracts, verify cross-file consistency, and
fail before printing success if any required artifact or evidence directory is
missing.
