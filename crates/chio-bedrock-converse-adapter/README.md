# chio-bedrock-converse-adapter

Provider-native scaffold for Amazon Bedrock Runtime Converse and
ConverseStream tool-use traffic in Chio.

## Scaffold status

This crate is an experimental scaffold. It owns offline lift/lower,
deterministic stream gating, and a mockable transport, but it does not yet
construct a real AWS client and makes no network calls in tests or normal
builds. The sole `Transport` implementation is `MockTransport`, and the live
SDK path returns `TransportError::NotImplemented`. The adapter currently
round-trips only against recorded conformance fixtures. Rows marked
`AWS Bedrock Runtime boundary` in the error taxonomy below pin the contract the
eventual live SDK transport must preserve, not behavior wired to a live
provider today.

## Pinned upstream SDK and region

- AWS SDK crate: `aws-sdk-bedrockruntime = "1.130.0"`, pinned once in the
  root workspace `Cargo.toml` and inherited by this crate.
- Region: `us-east-1` only for v1.
- API marker: `bedrock.converse.v1`, exposed as
  `chio_bedrock_converse_adapter::transport::BEDROCK_CONVERSE_API_VERSION`.

Bumping the SDK version, region, or API marker is a deliberate PR that must
re-record the Bedrock conformance fixtures. This scaffold does not construct
an AWS client and does not make network calls in tests or normal builds.

## Scope in this scaffold

The transport scaffold permits only the `Converse` and `ConverseStream`
operations and rejects any region other than `us-east-1`. Native structs cover
only the subset needed by later lift/lower work: `toolConfig`, `toolUse`, and
`toolResult`.

## IAM Principal Mapping

Production Bedrock initialization should use
`BedrockAdapter::new_with_signed_iam_principals_config_from_sts`. It performs
one STS `GetCallerIdentity` call per process, loads
`config/iam_principals.toml`, verifies the adjacent Sigstore bundle, and then
resolves the caller to the shared `Principal::BedrockIam` shape.

The required bundle path is the TOML path plus `.sigstore-bundle.json`:

```text
config/iam_principals.toml
config/iam_principals.toml.sigstore-bundle.json
```

The verifier is the shared `chio-attest-verify` `AttestVerifier` surface.
Operators must pass the expected Sigstore certificate identity and OIDC issuer
from their deployment policy. Missing config, missing bundle, rejected
signature, invalid TOML, unsupported schema, and unmapped callers all fail
closed before tool-use traffic is lifted.

Mapping order matters. The first exact or `*` wildcard match wins. For STS
assumed-role callers, the adapter preserves the original
`arn:aws:sts::...:assumed-role/.../...` session ARN in
`assumed_role_session_arn` and stores the canonical IAM role ARN in
`caller_arn`; it does not collapse the two fields.

## Adapter-visible error taxonomy

Bedrock Runtime surfaces batch failures as AWS JSON error envelopes and
ConverseStream failures as event-stream exception objects such as
`throttlingException` and `internalServerException`. This crate currently owns
offline lift/lower, deterministic stream gating, and mockable transport
validation. Rows marked `AWS Bedrock Runtime boundary` pin the
adapter-visible taxonomy that the eventual live SDK transport must preserve.
Rows marked `current adapter path` are emitted by the current lift/lower,
streaming, or evaluator path.

The table is parsed by `tests/error_taxonomy_doctest.rs`; keep each envelope
as one valid inline JSON object.

<!-- error-taxonomy:start -->
| ProviderError class | Native or boundary envelope | Source | Adapter-visible behavior |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| `ProviderError::RateLimited` | `{"event":"throttlingException","operation":"ConverseStream","message":"Rate exceeded","retry_after_ms":1000}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + AWS Bedrock Runtime boundary | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Preserve the retry hint when Bedrock exposes one, and classify throttling separately from service 5xx. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::ContentPolicy` | `{"status":200,"operation":"Converse","body":{"stopReason":"guardrail_intervened","output":{"message":{"content":[{"text":"blocked by guardrail"}]}},"trace":{"guardrail":{"action":"INTERVENED"}}}}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + AWS Bedrock Runtime boundary | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Surface Bedrock guardrail intervention as content-policy denial rather than a tool execution error. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::BadToolArgs` | `{"toolUse":{"toolUseId":"tooluse_bad_args","name":"get_weather","input":"not an object"}}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + current adapter path | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Fail closed when Bedrock emits `toolUse.input` that cannot become canonical JSON object arguments. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::Upstream5xx` | `{"event":"internalServerException","operation":"ConverseStream","status":500,"message":"Internal server error"}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + AWS Bedrock Runtime boundary | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Keep Bedrock service-side 5xx and unavailable envelopes visible for retry and audit policy. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::TransportTimeout` | `{"transport":"timeout","provider":"bedrock","operation":"Converse","elapsed_ms":30000}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + transport boundary | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Classify local timeout separately from Bedrock service exceptions. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::VerdictBudgetExceeded` | `{"provider":"bedrock","event":"contentBlockStart","observed_ms":300,"budget_ms":250}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + current adapter path | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Preserve the fabric verdict-budget error when the evaluator misses the 250ms stream gate. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |
| `ProviderError::Malformed` | `{"event":"contentBlockDelta","data":{"contentBlockIndex":0,"delta":{"toolUse":{"input":"{}"}}}}` | `urn:chio:error:provider:bedrock` (`CHIO-PROVIDER-BEDROCK`) + current adapter path | Bedrock Converse provider adapter returned a normalized provider error. Fail closed for impossible or out-of-order native ConverseStream shapes. Registry help: Inspect the provider error details and retry only when the adapter marks the failure transient. |

`ProviderError::Other` is intentionally absent. Native Bedrock envelopes must
map to a concrete class above, or fail closed as `Malformed` when the shape
cannot be trusted.

## Building

```bash
cargo build -p chio-bedrock-converse-adapter
```

## House rules

- No em dashes (U+2014) anywhere in code, comments, or documentation.
- Workspace clippy lints `unwrap_used = "deny"` and `expect_used = "deny"`
  apply; no exceptions.
- No `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, or bare `panic!()` in trust-boundary
  paths.
- Fail-closed: invalid region or API-surface config rejects at construction.
