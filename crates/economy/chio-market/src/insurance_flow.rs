//! End-to-end insurance flow on top of the liability market.
//!
//! This module connects the three shipped economic primitives:
//!
//! 1. `chio-underwriting::price_fiscal_premium` -- governed risk-based premium quote.
//! 2. `chio-market` -- binds the quote into a [`BoundPolicy`].
//! 3. `chio-settle` -- receives a [`ClaimSettlementRequest`] (field-compatible
//!    with `chio_settle::SettlementCommitment`) after a claim is approved
//!    against receipt evidence.
//!
//! The flow is intentionally small: [`quote_and_bind`] accepts a
//! [`PremiumSource`] (typically computed on the kernel side from
//! `ComplianceReport` / `BehavioralFeedReport`) and produces a
//! [`BoundPolicy`]. [`BoundPolicy::file_claim`] takes a
//! [`ClaimEvidence`] payload plus a [`ReceiptEvidenceSource`] that
//! re-verifies the referenced receipts against the kernel's signing key,
//! and a [`ClaimSettlementSink`] which, on approval, receives a
//! [`ClaimSettlementRequest`] (which embeds the same five required
//! fields as `chio_settle::SettlementCommitment`).
//!
//! **Crate graph note.** chio-settle depends on chio-core which (via
//! chio-autonomy) depends on chio-market, so chio-market cannot take a hard
//! dependency on chio-settle without creating a cycle. Callers sitting at
//! the top of the graph (for example chio-kernel) implement
//! [`ClaimSettlementSink`] to bridge the insurance-flow approval into an
//! `chio_settle::SettlementCommitment`. The fields on
//! [`ClaimSettlementRequest`] match `SettlementCommitment` 1:1 so the
//! bridge is a straight field copy.
//!
//! Traits are used instead of directly importing chio-kernel for the same
//! reason (`chio-kernel -> chio-market -> chio-underwriting` today; adding
//! a back-edge would create a cycle). Callers with chio-kernel in scope
//! populate the [`PremiumSource`] and [`ReceiptEvidenceSource`] using
//! the already-exposed kernel APIs (`compliance_score`,
//! `behavioral_anomaly_score`, and the receipt store).
