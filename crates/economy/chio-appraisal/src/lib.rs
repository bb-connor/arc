//! Runtime attestation appraisal artifacts and marketplace pricing for the
//! Chio protocol.
//!
//! This crate is used to appraise runtime attestation evidence and to derive
//! marketplace prices from it. It defines appraisal descriptors and an
//! artifact inventory, the attestation-verifier family taxonomy, and the
//! deterministic marketplace invocation-pricing model
//! (`compute_checked_marketplace_invocation_price`,
//! `compute_marketplace_invocation_price`, base prices, reputation tiers, and
//! tier discounts). Settlement-facing callers should use the checked pricing
//! boundary; the unchecked compute helper remains for compatibility with
//! callers that already validate their inputs. The underwriting, credit, and
//! market crates build on these types.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`marketplace_pricing`] -- per-invocation pricing with reputation-tier
//!   discounts.
