//! Store binding for IOU envelopes.
//!
//! A small abstraction over the durable store that persists IOU
//! envelopes minted by [`CreditEvaluatorHook`].
//! The binding lives in `chio-credit` so the trait surface stays
//! economic-crate-owned: the SQLite implementation lives in
//! `chio-store-sqlite::iou_store`.
//!
//! The binding is deliberately narrow: it does not expose query or
//! lifecycle methods, only the idempotent insert and a single
//! lookup keyed by `receipt_id`. A richer lifecycle surface can be
//! layered on top.
