//! Credit evaluator hook trait routing signed receipts to IOU envelopes.
//!
//! This wires the `chio-credit` crate to the kernel evaluator's
//! post-dispatch observer slot (the async-kernel observer). The hook
//! receives a fully signed [`ChioReceipt`] after
//! receipt finalization and returns either zero or one
//! [`IouEnvelope`]. Fail-closed semantics: signature-invalid or
//! malformed receipts mint nothing.
//!
//! The trait is intentionally minimal so the economic crate owns IOU
//! semantics; the kernel only needs to invoke the hook on each
//! finalized receipt and stash the result. Persistence is handled
//! by the store binding in [`crate::store_binding`].
