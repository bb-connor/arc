//! Settlement hook trait routing finalized Chio receipts through the
//! existing `chio-settle/ops.rs` pipeline.
//!
//! This exposes a kernel-evaluator observer surface for the
//! `chio-settle` crate (the async-kernel observer slot). The hook is invoked
//! at least once after a receipt has been signed and durably stored;
//! failure-to-settle never blocks dispatch
//! (the kernel observer slot consumes the [`SettlementHookError`] and
//! routes it to the retry/dead-letter machinery when a settlement
//! retry store is installed; otherwise the outcome is logged and
//! counted, never dropped).
//!
//! Settlement ordering is deterministic: implementers MUST process
//! observations sorted first by [`SettlementObservation::finalized_at`]
//! ascending and then by [`SettlementObservation::receipt_id`] lexically.
//!
//! Fail-closed semantics: signature-invalid, malformed, or unpriced
//! receipts return [`SettlementOutcome::Skipped`] without touching the
//! ops pipeline. The dispatch path is never rolled back by a
//! settlement failure.
