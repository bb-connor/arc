//! The one rule that decides whether a finding may open market state.
//!
//! Two storage profiles serve this market: a single-operator SQLite
//! authority and a tenant-isolated PostgreSQL authority. They keep their
//! own tables and their own row types, and for a while they each carried
//! their own copy of this decision, one in Rust and one in SQL. Nothing
//! made them agree, so a rule corrected in one profile could stay wrong in
//! the other, which is how a retracted finding stays purchasable on one
//! deployment and not the other.
//!
//! The decision lives here instead. A profile supplies the facts through
//! [`FindingStatusSource`] and this module sequences the checks, so both
//! reach the same verdict for the same durable state by construction. Each
//! profile keeps the referential integrity of its own rows; what is shared
//! is the market-visible legality.
