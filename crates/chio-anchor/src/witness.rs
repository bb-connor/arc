//! Public-witness lane clients for `chio.anchor_batch.v1`.
//!
//! Provides the [`AnchorWitnessClient`] trait, Rekor production verification,
//! OTS advisory parsing, and the [`WitnessState`] state machine consumed by
//! `verify_anchor_batch_with_witness_policy`.
//!
//! The clients implement the actual HTTP protocols used by Rekor REST
//! and OpenTimestamps calendars. Tests substitute mock servers where
//! load-bearing verification is available.
//!
//! # Soundness notes (PR #594 review fixes)
//!
//! - The receipt's `body_hash` binds a stable [`BatchHashInput`] view
//!   of the batch body that EXCLUDES `witness_state` and lane-assigned
//!   witness identifiers. This breaks the circular reference where
//!   signing a witnessed body would otherwise change the body the
//!   receipt was supposed to commit to.
//! - Honoring `WitnessState::Witnessed` against
//!   `require_public_witness=true` requires an active call to
//!   [`AnchorWitnessClient::verify_inclusion`]. Self-carried
//!   `Witnessed` states are not sufficient.
//! - `WitnessState::Stale` is admitted only if the recomputed
//!   [`batch_body_hash`] of the current batch maps to a verifier-owned
//!   `verified_at` timestamp inside the caller-supplied
//!   [`VerifiedWitnessCache`]. Producers cannot bootstrap themselves
//!   into the verified cache or refresh it by signing a fresh
//!   `last_verified` value.
