//! `QuoteVerifier` shared shapes.
//!
//! This module defines the trait surface every TEE quote backend ships
//! against. It is the single import point for downstream consumers:
//!
//! - The revocation oracle (`crates/chio-revocation/`) consumes
//!   [`VerifiedQuote`] when a revocation root is signed by a kernel that
//!   ran inside an attested TEE.
//! - Hardware custody envelopes (`crates/chio-tee/`) consume
//!   [`expect_report_data`] before declaring a custody handoff valid.
//!
//! All shapes here are intentionally minimal: a TEE family discriminator,
//! a normalized TCB status, the verification context that every backend
//! must bind into the quote, and the verification result. Backend-specific
//! collateral types (TDX DCAP collateral, SEV-SNP VLEK / VCEK chains,
//! Nitro NSM root) live in their own modules and never leak into this
//! shape.
