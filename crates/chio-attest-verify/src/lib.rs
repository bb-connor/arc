//! Single source of truth for Sigstore verification across the chio workspace.
//! No other crate is permitted to call `sigstore-rs` directly.
//!
//! # Trust boundary
//!
//! Every public method on [`AttestVerifier`] is fail-closed. A method that
//! returns `Ok(VerifiedAttestation)` MUST mean that:
//!
//! - the artifact bytes were hashed and matched the signed digest,
//! - the signing certificate chains to the embedded Fulcio trust root,
//! - the certificate's OIDC issuer matches the expected issuer exactly,
//! - the certificate identity SAN matches the caller-supplied regexp,
//! - and `rekor_inclusion_verified` truthfully reflects whether this crate
//!   verified Rekor Merkle inclusion and the Signed Entry Timestamp (SET).
//!
//! Any input that does not satisfy all of those properties yields one of
//! the [`AttestError`] variants. There is no path through this crate that
//! returns `Ok(_)` on a partial verification.
//!
//! # Forbidden constructs
//!
//! This crate sits on a trust boundary: it forbids `unwrap`, `expect`, and
//! unsafe blocks at the lint level. The reviewer checklist for any PR
//! touching this crate also requires a
//! `rg -n 'todo!\(|unimplemented!\(|panic!\('` sweep across `src/` and
//! `tests/`.
