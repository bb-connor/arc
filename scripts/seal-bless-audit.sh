#!/usr/bin/env bash
# seal-bless-audit.sh -- rewrite `<commit-sha-pending>` rows in the bless
# audit log to the real commit SHA of the bless commit they describe.
#
# Background
# ----------
# At bless time the staged goldens, audit-log line, and (optionally)
# docs/replay-compat.md are not yet committed, so `git rev-parse HEAD`
# does not yet reflect the SHA the audit line will be embedded in. The
# bless flow (see tests/replay/src/bless.rs, PENDING_SHA_MARKER) records
# the placeholder `<commit-sha-pending>` instead. Once the bless commit
# (or its squash-merge counterpart) is known, this script rewrites every
# placeholder row in tests/replay/.bless-audit.log to that SHA in place.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   scripts/seal-bless-audit.sh                       # uses HEAD (typical)
#   scripts/seal-bless-audit.sh <commit-sha>          # explicit SHA (e.g.
#                                                       a squash-merge SHA
#                                                       you obtained via
#                                                       gh pr view --json
#                                                       mergeCommit)
#   scripts/seal-bless-audit.sh -h | --help
#
# The script makes a single sed-like rewrite of the audit log and stages
# the file (`git add tests/replay/.bless-audit.log`); the resulting diff
# should be reviewed and committed with a message like
# `chore(replay): seal bless-audit SHAs to <commit-sha>`.
#
# Idempotency: re-running with no placeholders left exits with code 0
# and prints "no placeholders to seal".
#
# Spec: .planning/trajectory/04-deterministic-replay.md (Phase 2 task 4),
# audit-log clause 7 + "<sha> discipline" header note.

usage() {
  cat <<'USAGE'
seal-bless-audit.sh -- replace <commit-sha-pending> placeholders in the
bless audit log with the real commit SHA.

Usage:
  scripts/seal-bless-audit.sh                # uses HEAD
  scripts/seal-bless-audit.sh <commit-sha>   # explicit SHA
  scripts/seal-bless-audit.sh -h | --help

Behaviour:
  - Locates the repo root (script lives in scripts/).
  - Counts <commit-sha-pending> rows in the audit log; exits 0 with a
    note if there are none.
  - Validates the supplied (or auto-detected) SHA is a known commit via
    `git rev-parse --verify <sha>^{commit}`.
  - Replaces every placeholder occurrence with the abbreviated SHA
    (matches the existing audit-log convention of short SHAs).
  - Stages the audit log with `git add` so the operator commits the
    rewrite in a follow-up commit.

The follow-up commit message convention is:
  chore(replay): seal bless-audit SHAs to <short-sha>
