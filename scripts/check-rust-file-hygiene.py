"""Fail on oversized hand-maintained Rust files and malformed generated Rust.

Allowlist policy: entries are debt, not configuration. Renew only through
`--ratchet`, which re-caps every entry at the file's current size (caps can
only shrink), drops entries whose files came back under their base limit,
and advances the expiry one month. Hand-editing an entry to raise a cap or
extend an expiry without shrinking the file defeats the gate.
