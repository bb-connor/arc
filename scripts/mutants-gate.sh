# mutants-gate.sh - Decide advisory or blocking posture for cargo-mutants.
#
# Source-doc anchor:
#   .planning/trajectory/02-fuzzing-post-pr13.md
#   "Mutation-testing CI shape (Phase 3)" -> advisory/blocking flip via
#   releases.toml. Decision lock: id=mutation-testing-gate-posture
#   (advisory for one release cycle after M02 P3 merges, blocking
#   thereafter; flip event is the next release tag).
#
# Reads releases.toml at the repository root:
#
#   [mutants]
#   phase3_merge_tag = "vX.Y.Z"   # tag of the M02 P3 merge release
#   cycle_end_tag    = ""          # filled in by the next release after P3
#
# Posture rule:
#   - cycle_end_tag empty (default today)  -> advisory; exit 0 unconditionally.
#   - cycle_end_tag non-empty               -> blocking; exit 1 when the
#                                              upstream cargo-mutants step
#                                              reported a non-zero exit
#                                              (surviving mutants beyond
#                                              the per-crate budget).
#
# Environment:
#   MUTANTS_PACKAGE     : crate name being scored (informational).
#   MUTANTS_OUTPUT_DIR  : directory holding cargo-mutants outcomes.json
#                         (informational; reserved for the M02 P3 catch-
#                         ratio threshold check).
#   MUTANTS_EXIT        : exit code from the cargo-mutants step
#                         (0 = clean, non-zero = survivors).
#   MUTANTS_GATE_OVERRIDE_REASON
#                       : optional escape hatch (M02.P3.T2). When set to a
#                         non-empty string, a blocking-fail verdict is
#                         downgraded to a loud advisory pass: the script
#                         emits a `WARN mutants-gate-override` line on
#                         stderr, appends an audit row to
#                         docs/fuzzing/mutants-overrides.log (timestamp,
#                         package, exit code, cycle_end_tag, reason) and
#                         exits 0. Empty/unset = no override (default).
#                         The corresponding label-based override path is a
#                         PR titled `mutants-gate-override` that clears
#                         cycle_end_tag in releases.toml; CODEOWNERS gates
#                         that PR on principal-engineer review.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 advisory pass (or blocking pass when survivors == 0, or
#     blocking-fail downgraded by MUTANTS_GATE_OVERRIDE_REASON)
#   1 blocking fail (cycle_end_tag non-empty AND survivors detected AND
#     no override reason supplied)
#
# This script is invoked by .github/workflows/mutants.yml's mutants-pr
# and mutants-nightly jobs. It is also safe to run locally:
#
#   MUTANTS_EXIT=0 bash scripts/mutants-gate.sh
#
# Today releases.toml ships with cycle_end_tag empty so this script
# always exits 0; the M02 P3 release-binaries auto-flip will populate
# cycle_end_tag and start enforcing without a workflow edit.
