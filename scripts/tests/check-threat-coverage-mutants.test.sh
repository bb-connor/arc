# Self-test for scripts/check-threat-coverage-mutants.sh.
#
# Owner: trajectory-4 wave-0 / E0.4.
#
# Exercises the four scenarios spelled out in the E0.4 plan:
#
#   1. A row with valid evidence (caught >= 1) PASSES.
#   2. A row with `needs_real_run: true` produces a downgrade hint
#      (`bootstrap_placeholder`) but does NOT fail the gate.
#   3. A row with `coverage_state: weak_coverage` in the JSON
#      causes `check-threat-coverage.sh` (the file-existence gate
#      that owns enum policy) to FAIL with a clear message naming
#      the row.
#   4. A missing evidence file produces a downgrade hint
#      (`missing_evidence`) and FAILS the gate (without --dry-run)
#      while passing under --dry-run.
#
# We also lock in two extra invariants:
#   - `caught: 0` without `needs_real_run` produces `zero_kills`
#     and FAILS.
#   - A covered row with no `coveredBy`/`covered_by_tests` produces
#     `no_coveredby` and FAILS.
