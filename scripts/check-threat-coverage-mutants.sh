# Per-row cargo-mutants gate for threat coverage.
#
# Owner: threat-coverage evidence gate.
#
# The first threat-coverage gate only enforced "the threat-stub file
# exists and does not call unimplemented!()", so a one-line
# `assert!(true)` body satisfies the 20/0/0 gate without exercising
# any real defensive logic. This script is the per-row mutation-
# testing backstop.
#
# For each threat in `spec/security/chio-threat-model.v1.json`
# whose `coverage_state` is `covered` (or absent, which defaults to
# covered) or `partial`:
#
#   1. Read the threat's `coveredBy` (preferred) or
#      `covered_by_tests` cross-link list. If both are missing or
#      empty, emit a downgrade hint with reason `no_coveredby` and
#      exit 1 (or, in `--dry-run` mode, continue).
#
#   2. Look up the evidence file at
#      `audits/evidence/threats/<threat_id>.json`. The file is
#      expected to record the most recent mutation-testing run with
#      shape:
#
#          {
#            "caught": <int>,
#            "survivors": [<string>, ...],
#            "ran_at": "<iso8601>",
#            "needs_real_run": <bool, optional>,
#            "timestamp_kind": "cargo-mutants-run" | "command-wall-clock"
#                | "bootstrap-placeholder" | "generated-metadata" (optional),
#            "evidence_status": "cargo-mutants-run" | "conformance-only"
#                (optional),
#            "mutation_evidence_status": "complete" | "not-run" (optional),
#            "promotion_status": "promoted" | "not-promoted" (optional)
#          }
#
#      A row with `needs_real_run: true` is treated as
#      `weak_coverage` regardless of `caught`, and a downgrade hint
#      is emitted with reason `bootstrap_placeholder`. By default
#      bootstrap placeholders are hard failures: they are not release
#      evidence and must not count as covered.
#
#      Generated conformance metadata is not mutation evidence. A row
#      whose metadata says `generated-metadata`, `conformance-only`,
#      `not-run`, or `not-promoted` cannot pass the mutants evidence
#      gate by flipping `needs_real_run` to false and `caught` to a
#      positive number.
#
#   3. If the evidence file is missing, emit a downgrade hint with
#      reason `missing_evidence` and exit 1 (unless `--dry-run`).
#
#   4. If `caught == 0` and `needs_real_run` is not true, emit a
#      downgrade hint with reason `zero_kills` and exit 1 (unless
#      `--dry-run`).
#
#   5. If `caught >= 1`, the row passes.
#
# Partial rows are still required to carry evidence. The row can remain
# `partial` in the threat model, but the defended sub-vector must have
# a present evidence file, a non-placeholder run status, and caught >= 1.
#
# Downgrade hint format (single line, machine-grep-able):
#
#     WEAK: <threat_id> should be marked weak_coverage; reason=<reason>
#
# Where `<reason>` is one of:
#   - `missing_evidence` - audits/evidence/threats/<id>.json is missing
#   - `zero_kills`       - the evidence file records caught == 0
#   - `no_coveredby`     - no coveredBy / covered_by_tests cross-link
#   - `bootstrap_placeholder` - needs_real_run is true before expiry; still a
#     normal failure unless --allow-bootstrap-placeholders is explicitly set
#   - `bootstrap_expired` - needs_real_run is true but today >=
#     BOOTSTRAP_EXPIRES_DATE; the accommodation has expired and the
#     row is now a real failure
#   - `inconsistent_bootstrap` - needs_real_run is true with a non-1970
#     `ran_at` timestamp (the stale-timestamp check); a real timestamp
#     contradicts the placeholder claim
#   - `non_mutants_metadata` - the row tries to pass with generated,
#     conformance-only, not-run, bootstrap, or not-promoted metadata
#
# Modes:
#   - default: any downgrade hint causes exit 1, including
#     bootstrap_placeholder.
#   - --dry-run: every downgrade hint is reported but exit code is 0,
#     so authors can iterate locally before wiring evidence. NOTE:
#     --dry-run is refused when CI=true so a CI run cannot land a PR
#     by relying on the lenient mode.
#   - --allow-bootstrap-placeholders: bootstrap placeholders are
#     reported but do not fail. This exists only for non-release
#     scaffolding fixtures; CI, required-gate, release, and preflight callers
#     cannot use it.
#
# Bootstrap expiry:
#   The `needs_real_run: true` accommodation is bounded by
#   BOOTSTRAP_EXPIRES_DATE (default 2026-08-01, 90 days out from
#   the threat-coverage hardening pass). After that date the script treats every
#   `needs_real_run: true` evidence file as a bootstrap_expired
#   failure. CHIO_BOOTSTRAP_EXPIRY=YYYY-MM-DD overrides for local
#   development and tests.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - all covered rows have caught >= 1 evidence (or --dry-run, or
#       --allow-bootstrap-placeholders for non-release bootstrap-only fixtures).
#   1 - one or more covered rows are missing real evidence and we are
#       not in --dry-run.
#   2 - argument or config error (unknown flag, --dry-run in CI,
#       --allow-bootstrap-placeholders in CI/release posture, invalid
#       CHIO_BOOTSTRAP_EXPIRY, or missing python3).

set -euo pipefail

# Hard expiry for the bootstrap-placeholder accommodation. After this date,
