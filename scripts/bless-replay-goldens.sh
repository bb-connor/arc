# Refuses to invoke the binary when the working tree contains changes to the

usage() {
  cat <<'USAGE'
bless-replay-goldens.sh -- bless replay goldens via chio-replay-gate.

Usage:
  BLESS_REASON="rationale" scripts/bless-replay-goldens.sh
  scripts/bless-replay-goldens.sh -h | --help

Required environment:
  BLESS_REASON   Free-form rationale string. Recorded in
                 tests/replay/.bless-audit.log alongside timestamp, branch,
                 SHA, and committer identity.

Behaviour:
  - Sets CHIO_BLESS=1 and exports BLESS_REASON for the child process.
  - Refuses to run if CI=true (CI is banned from blessing).
  - Refuses to run on branch 'main' or 'release/*'.
  - Refuses to run if changes exist under crates/chio-core/src/,
    crates/chio-core-types/src/, or crates/chio-kernel/src/receipt_support.rs
    without a corresponding modification to docs/replay-compat.md.
  - Refuses to run if other unrelated paths (outside the bless allowlist of
    tests/replay/goldens/, tests/replay/.bless-audit.log, and
    docs/replay-compat.md) are dirty.
  - Invokes: cargo run --release -p chio-replay-gate -- --bless

The full gate (TTY check, audit-log coupling, BLESS_REASON validation,
branch protection coupling) is enforced by tests/replay/src/bless.rs in
the binary itself; this wrapper provides a fast-fail user-friendly front
end before the binary runs.

After a successful bless, commit the goldens, the audit-log delta, and any
docs/replay-compat.md update in a single commit.
