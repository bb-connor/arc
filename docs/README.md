- [Velocity Guards](reference/VELOCITY_GUARDS.md) - token-bucket rate limiting per capability and grant
- [Agent Economy](reference/AGENT_ECONOMY.md) - technical design for governed transaction controls and payment interop
- [Agent Reputation](reference/AGENT_REPUTATION.md) - local scoring, issuance gating, and reputation surfaces
- [Competitive Landscape](reference/COMPETITIVE_LANDSCAPE.md) - agent protocols, payment rails, and identity standards in the surrounding space

## Operations
