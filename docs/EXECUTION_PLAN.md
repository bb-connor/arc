# Chio Execution Plan

## Purpose

This document turns [ROADMAP_V1.md](ROADMAP_V1.md) into an execution plan.

It answers:

- what gets built first
- what can run in parallel
- which crates or modules are touched
- what each milestone must prove before the next one starts
- what the first 30, 60, and 90 days should look like

The roadmap describes destination and phases.

This plan describes execution order, dependency management, and deliverable boundaries.

Initial execution artifacts:

- ADRs: [adr/README.md](adr/README.md)
- issue-ready epics: [epics/README.md](epics/README.md)
- post-review closing plan: [POST_REVIEW_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](POST_REVIEW_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)

## Planning Assumptions

- the repo remains a Rust workspace
- `chio-core`, `chio-kernel`, `chio-guards`, `chio-policy`, `chio-manifest`, and `chio-mcp-adapter` remain the base crates
- early work should prefer modules inside existing crates over immediate crate explosion
- compatibility at the edge and stronger trust in the core remain the primary strategy
- HushSpec becomes the canonical policy path before `v1`

## Success Conditions

Execution is on track if all of the following become true in order:

1. the runtime has a session abstraction instead of only ad hoc request handling
2. compiled HushSpec is the real runtime contract
3. a stock MCP client can talk to Chio for tool workflows
4. Chio supports resources and prompts as first-class concepts
5. nested sampling and elicitation flows are implemented safely
6. long-running operations have correct progress, cancellation, and receipt semantics
7. remote trust no longer depends on in-memory state
8. compatibility claims are backed by fixtures and conformance tests

## Program Structure

Use five execution lanes.

| Lane | Purpose | Primary repo areas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol` | session model, JSON-RPC, MCP edge, message evolution | `chio-core`, `chio-kernel`, new edge modules |
| `policy` | HushSpec runtime integration and policy fixtures | `chio-policy`, `chio-cli` |
| `runtime` | providers, dispatch, streaming, nested flows | `chio-kernel`, `chio-mcp-adapter` |
| `trust` | CA, revocation, receipt persistence, remote identity | new services plus `chio-kernel` |
| `interop` | adapters, fixtures, conformance, migration docs | `chio-mcp-adapter`, `tests`, `docs` |

## Current planning note

The repo has advanced far beyond the early E0-E8 bootstrap described in the original version of this plan.

The generic late-stage hardening bucket is no longer specific enough.

Post-review closing work is now split into focused epics:

- `E9` HA trust-control reliability
- `E10` remote runtime hardening
- `E11` cross-transport concurrency semantics
- `E12` security boundary completion
- `E13` policy and adoption unification
- `E14` hardening and release candidate

See [POST_REVIEW_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](POST_REVIEW_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) and the new epic specs in [epics/README.md](epics/README.md).

## v2.0 Shipped Features

The following items that appear as planned work elsewhere in this document shipped in v2.0. References to them as "planned" or "proposed" in earlier sections are superseded by this note.

### Monetary budgets (shipped in v2.0)

`MonetaryAmount`, `max_cost_per_invocation`, and `max_total_cost` on `ToolGrant` are implemented in `crates/chio-core/src/capability.rs`. `BudgetStore::try_charge_cost` enforces atomic monetary limits in `crates/chio-kernel/src/budget_store.rs`. `FinancialReceiptMetadata` is embedded in the receipt `metadata` field for every monetized invocation. See [AGENT_ECONOMY.md](AGENT_ECONOMY.md) for the full design; Phase 1 of that document is now implemented. Operator guide: [MONETARY_BUDGETS_GUIDE.md](MONETARY_BUDGETS_GUIDE.md).

### DPoP proof-of-possession (shipped in v2.0)

`ToolGrant.dpop_required` enables per-grant DPoP enforcement. The kernel validates `chio.dpop_proof.v1` proofs with nonce replay prevention. Implementation is in `crates/chio-kernel/src/dpop.rs`. Operator guide: [DPOP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](DPOP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md).

### Receipt query API (shipped in v2.0)

`GET /v1/receipts/query` on the trust-control service supports eight filter dimensions and cursor-based pagination. The CLI exposes `arc receipt list` with equivalent filters. Capability lineage JOINs (`/v1/lineage/{capability_id}/chain`, `GET /v1/agents/{subject_key}/receipts`) are also available. See `crates/chio-kernel/src/receipt_query.rs` and `crates/chio-kernel/src/capability_lineage.rs`. Operator guide: [RECEIPT_QUERY_API.md](RECEIPT_QUERY_API.md).

### Velocity guard (shipped in v2.0)

`VelocityGuard` token-bucket rate limiting per `(capability_id, grant_index)` is in `crates/chio-guards/src/velocity.rs`. It runs in the standard guard pipeline before any tool server invocation. Operator guide: [VELOCITY_GUARDS.md](VELOCITY_GUARDS.md).

### Merkle-committed receipt batches (shipped in v2.0)

`KernelCheckpoint` commits batches of receipts to a Merkle root signed by the kernel key. See `crates/chio-kernel/src/checkpoint.rs`.

### SIEM exporters (shipped in v2.0)

Splunk HEC and Elasticsearch bulk exporters with a bounded dead-letter queue ship in `crates/chio-siem`, enabled via `--features siem` on `chio-cli`.

### Receipt retention with time/size rotation (shipped in v2.0)

`RetentionConfig` on `KernelConfig` supports automatic archival by age (days) and live database size. See `crates/chio-kernel/src/receipt_store.rs`.

### TypeScript SDK 1.0 (shipped in v2.0)

`@chio-protocol/sdk` v1.0.0 ships in `packages/sdk/chio-ts/`. It covers capability invariants, receipt verification, DPoP proof construction, a receipt query client, and Streamable HTTP session management.

### Compliance documents (shipped in v2.0)

Operator-facing compliance references are in `docs/compliance/`:

- `docs/compliance/colorado-sb-24-205.md`
- `docs/compliance/eu-ai-act-article-19.md`

## Decision Gates

These are blocking design decisions. They should be resolved explicitly and documented before dependent implementation proceeds.

### D1: Edge protocol shape

Decision:

- direct JSON-RPC all the way into runtime
- or JSON-RPC edge translated into a native internal session model

Recommendation:

- JSON-RPC at the edge, normalized internal session model underneath

Blocks:

- E1
- E3

### D2: Scope evolution timing

Decision:

- keep `ChioScope` tool-only until after tool parity
- or widen the grant model before resources/prompts land

Recommendation:

- keep `ToolGrant` in the first session and tool-parity milestone
- design `Grant` enum before resource/prompt implementation starts

Blocks:

- E4
- E5

### D3: Nested flow model

Decision:

- sampling/elicitation as child requests in the same session
- or separate nested sub-sessions

Recommendation:

- child requests inside the same session with lineage-aware receipts

Blocks:

- E5
- E6

### D4: First receipt backend

Decision:

- SQLite
- append-only local file
- remote service first

Recommendation:

- SQLite first, remote service second

Blocks:

- E7

### D5: MCP edge location

Decision:

- overload `chio-mcp-adapter`
- or introduce separate MCP edge runtime

Recommendation:

- keep `chio-mcp-adapter` as migration adapter
- add separate MCP edge module or crate

Blocks:

- E3
- E4

## Milestones

Use milestone gates instead of calendar promises until team capacity is known.

| Milestone | Must complete |
| --- | --- |
| `M0` | E0 |
| `M1` | E1 + E2 |
| `M2` | E3 |
| `M3` | E4 |
| `M4` | E5 + E6 |
| `M5` | E7 |
| `M6` | E8 |
| `M7` | E9 + E12 |
| `M8` | E10 + E11 |
| `M9` | E13 |
| `M10` | E14 |

## Parallelization Rules

These tasks can run in parallel once dependencies are satisfied:

- E1 and E2 after E0
- policy fixtures in E2 while session internals in E1 are underway
- tool metadata parity in E3 while result parity and fixture work also proceed
- E7 trust-service interface design can start during late E4 if it does not block feature epics
- migration docs in E8 can begin as soon as E3 has stable behavior
- E12 design can overlap with E9 reliability work
- E10 and E11 can overlap once trust and session assumptions are stable enough
- E13 documentation and example preparation can start before the SDK slice lands

These tasks should not run ahead of prerequisites:

- E5 before session lineage model exists
- E6 before cancellation bookkeeping exists
- E7 implementation before D4 is decided
- E8 compatibility claims before conformance fixtures exist
- E10 before E7 remote runtime and E9 trust reliability are stable enough
- E12 before E5 roots substrate exists
- E13 before E2 canonical policy runtime exists

- demo artifact or fixture proving the milestone

Each work package should record:

- repo areas touched
- blocking dependencies
- acceptance tests added
- docs updated

## Definition of Done

A work package is done only if:

- implementation merged
- tests added or updated
- docs updated
- compatibility impact documented
- security impact documented

## Final Note

The critical path is:

- session model
- canonical policy runtime
- MCP-compatible edge
- first-class non-tool primitives
- nested-flow safety

Everything else matters, but if that path stalls, the project will accumulate impressive components without becoming a real replacement.
