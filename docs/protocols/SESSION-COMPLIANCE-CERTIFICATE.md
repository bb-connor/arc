## 1. Problem Statement

Enterprises deploying Chio-governed agent systems must demonstrate to auditors,
regulators, and internal compliance teams that every agent session operated
within its authorized boundaries. Chio already produces Ed25519-signed receipts
for every tool call and commits them to Merkle-rooted checkpoint batches. However,
reconstructing compliance from individual receipts requires tooling that
understands the full protocol: verifying signatures, replaying scope checks,
summing budget consumption, and confirming chain continuity.

A **Session Compliance Certificate** is a single, self-contained, cryptographically
signed artifact that proves an entire agent session complied with policy. It
composes receipt-level evidence into one auditor-ready document that a third party
can verify without replaying every guard evaluation.

## 2. What a Compliance Certificate Proves

A valid certificate makes six assertions about the session it covers:

1. **Capability validity.** Every tool call presented a capability token that was non-expired, non-revoked, and signed by a recognized Capability Authority at invocation time.
2. **Scope containment.** No capability was exercised outside the tool grants, resource grants, and prompt grants declared in its `ChioScope`.
3. **Budget compliance.** No `ToolGrant` with `max_invocations`, `max_cost_per_invocation`, or `max_total_cost` constraints had those limits exceeded.
4. **Guard passage.** Every `GuardEvidence` entry attached to every receipt has `verdict: true`. No denied guard evaluation was bypassed.
5. **No privilege escalation.** The effective scope never widened beyond what the root capability authority granted. Delegation chains maintained monotonic attenuation.
6. **Receipt chain completeness.** The receipt chain is gap-free, with each receipt hash-linked to its predecessor. No receipts were omitted, replayed, or reordered.

The certificate may also carry supplemental execution-context evidence for
auditors and insurers: model/provider identifiers, policy or prompt bundle
hashes, human-approval references, runtime-attestation summaries, and
redaction metadata describing what evidence was intentionally omitted from the
portable artifact.

### 3.2 Serialization

All certificate fields use canonical JSON (RFC 8785 / JCS) for deterministic
hashing and signature verification, consistent with all other Chio signed
artifacts. The signature covers `canonical_json_bytes(&body)`.

## 4. Generation Process

The kernel generates a certificate by walking the complete receipt log for a
session. The algorithm is fail-closed: any anomaly aborts generation and returns
an error rather than issuing a misleading certificate.

### 4.1 Algorithm

```
generate_compliance_certificate(session_id) -> Result<SessionComplianceCertificate>

1.  Load all StoredToolReceipt and StoredChildReceipt records for session_id,
    ordered by sequence number. If empty, return Err(EmptySession).

2.  Initialize accumulators:
      receipt_hashes: Vec<Vec<u8>>, prev_hash: Option<String> = None,
      scope_summary, budget_map, guard_summary, execution_context,
      approval_refs, redaction_profile

3.  For each receipt in sequence order:
      a. Verify Ed25519 signature against embedded kernel_key.
         Fail: Err(InvalidReceiptSignature { receipt_id }).
      b. Verify chain continuity:
         Compute hash = SHA-256(canonical_json_bytes(receipt.body())).
         If prev_hash is Some, assert linkage. Update prev_hash.
      c. Verify capability scope alignment:
         Look up CapabilityToken by receipt.capability_id.
         Confirm (tool_server, tool_name) falls within scope.grants.
         Fail: Err(ScopeViolation { receipt_id }).
      d. Accumulate budget usage from FinancialReceiptMetadata.
         If max_invocations or max_total_cost exceeded: Err(BudgetExceeded).
      e. Verify guard evidence: assert all GuardEvidence.verdict == true.
         False verdict on Allow decision: Err(GuardBypass { receipt_id }).
      f. Append canonical_json_bytes(receipt.body()) to receipt_hashes.
      g. Update scope_summary with observed tools, resources, prompts.
      h. Accumulate execution-context summaries (model/provider IDs, policy or
         prompt bundle hashes, runtime-attestation metadata, approval refs).

4.  Build MerkleTree::from_leaves(&receipt_hashes). Record merkle_root.
5.  Assemble SessionComplianceCertificateBody with all accumulated data.
6.  Sign: keypair.sign_canonical(&body) -> (signature, _bytes).
7.  Return SessionComplianceCertificate { body, signature }.
```

### 4.2 Error Conditions

| Error | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `EmptySession` | No receipts found for the session |
| `InvalidReceiptSignature` | A receipt failed Ed25519 verification |
| `ChainDiscontinuity` | Gap or reordering in the receipt hash chain |
| `ScopeViolation` | Tool call fell outside its capability's scope |
| `BudgetExceeded` | Grant invocation or cost limit was exceeded |
| `GuardBypass` | Allow decision issued despite a failed guard |
| `CapabilityExpired` | Receipt references a capability expired at invocation time |
| `DelegationViolation` | Delegation chain failed monotonic attenuation |

Any error means the session is **non-compliant** and no certificate is issued.

## 5. Verification Process

### 5.1 Certificate-Only Verification (Lightweight)

```
verify_compliance_certificate(cert, trusted_kernel_keys) -> Result<()>

1. Verify cert.signature against cert.body using cert.body.issuer_key.
2. Confirm cert.body.issuer_key is in trusted_kernel_keys.
3. Confirm cert.body.schema == "chio.session_compliance_certificate.v1".
4. Confirm cert.body.guard_summary.failed == 0.
5. For each budget_summary entry: assert usage <= limit where limits exist.
6. Confirm time_range.start <= time_range.end and total_receipt_count > 0.
7. Confirm tool_receipt_count + child_receipt_count == total_receipt_count.
```

This trusts the kernel's assertions. Sufficient for routine audit trails where
the kernel itself is in the trusted computing base.

### 5.2 Full Verification (With Receipt Bundle)

```
verify_compliance_certificate_full(cert, receipt_bundle, trusted_kernel_keys) -> Result<()>

1. Perform all lightweight checks from 5.1.
2. Confirm receipt_bundle.tool_receipts.len() == cert.body.tool_receipt_count.
3. Confirm receipt_bundle.child_receipts.len() == cert.body.child_receipt_count.
4. Confirm total receipt count matches cert.body.total_receipt_count.
5. Verify each receipt's Ed25519 signature and kernel_key membership.
6. Rebuild MerkleTree from canonical_json_bytes of each receipt body in
   canonical session order.
7. Assert rebuilt root == cert.body.merkle_root.
8. Verify chain_head/chain_tail match first/last receipt body hashes.
```

Full verification is independent of the issuing kernel and provides non-repudiation.

## 6. Capability Attestation Chaining

### 6.1 Hash Chain Construction

Each receipt carries a `content_hash` (SHA-256 of its canonical JSON body),
computed at creation time. The certificate anchors this chain via `chain_head`
(first receipt hash) and `chain_tail` (last receipt hash).

### 6.2 Integrity Properties

| Property | Detection method |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Gap** (missing receipt) | Sequence number discontinuity during generation |
| **Replay** (duplicate) | Duplicate sequence number or content hash |
| **Reordering** | Timestamp or sequence inversion during ordered walk |
| **Truncation** | Tool/child/total receipt count mismatch between certificate and bundle |
| **Forgery** | Ed25519 signature verification failure |

### 6.3 Merkle Anchoring

The certificate's Merkle root commits the entire ordered receipt set using Chio's
RFC 6962-compatible tree (`MerkleTree::from_leaves`):

- Leaf: `SHA-256(byte(0x00) || canonical_json_bytes(receipt.body()))`
- Node: `SHA-256(byte(0x01) || left || right)`

Where `byte(0x00)` is a single zero byte and `||` denotes byte concatenation.

A verifier holding the certificate and a single receipt can obtain a
`MerkleProof` and confirm inclusion against `merkle_root` without the full bundle.

## 7. Regulatory Mapping

> **Disclaimer**: These mappings illustrate how Chio artifacts can provide
> evidence for regulatory requirements. Regulatory compliance depends on
> deployment context, organizational controls, and legal interpretation.
> Consult legal counsel before relying on Chio artifacts for regulatory claims.

## 8. Integration Points

### 8.1 Kernel API

```rust
impl ChioKernel {
    /// Generate a compliance certificate for a completed session.
    pub async fn generate_compliance_certificate(
        &self,
        session_id: &SessionId,
    ) -> Result<SessionComplianceCertificate, ComplianceCertificateError>;

    /// Verify a certificate against this kernel's trusted key set.
    pub fn verify_compliance_certificate(
        &self,
        cert: &SessionComplianceCertificate,
    ) -> Result<(), ComplianceCertificateError>;
}
```

### 8.2 CLI

```
arc cert generate --session <session-id> [--output <path>]
arc cert verify   --cert <path> [--receipts <path>] [--trusted-keys <path>]
arc cert inspect  --cert <path>
```

### 8.3 SIEM Export

Certificates export as structured events via `EvidenceExportBundle`:

```json
{
  "event_type": "chio.session_compliance_certificate",
  "event_id": "<certificate_id>",
  "session_id": "<session_id>",
  "agent_id": "<agent_id>",
  "timestamp": 1718300000,
  "total_receipt_count": 47,
  "compliant": true,
  "merkle_root": "0x<64 hex chars>",
  "certificate_signature": "<128 hex chars>"
}
```

### 8.4 Web3 Anchoring

The certificate hash (`SHA-256(canonical_json_bytes(certificate.body))`) can be
anchored on-chain via `Web3SettlementDispatchArtifact`, providing a public
timestamped proof independent of the issuing kernel's availability.

This session ran 12 tool calls plus 3 child receipts across two servers,
consumed 8 of 50 search invocations and 1 of 5 file writes ($2.50 of $100.00
USD budget), passed all 24 guard evaluations, carried a recorded change-
approval reference, and completed within one hour. The certificate was signed 5
seconds after the last receipt.
