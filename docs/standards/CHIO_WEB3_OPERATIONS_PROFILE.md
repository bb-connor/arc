# Chio Web3 Operations Profile

## Purpose

This profile closes phases `165` and `175` by freezing the bounded
production-operations surface for Chio's shipped web3 runtime stack.

It covers four connected surfaces:

- the existing `chio-link` runtime monitor and pause-control report
- the new `chio-anchor` runtime report for indexer drift, replay, and
  publication recovery
- the new `chio-settle` runtime report for finality, reorg recovery, and
  refund-first emergency posture
- persisted control-state snapshots and ordered control traces for each web3
  runtime
- the qualification matrix proving these operations surfaces fail closed

## Shipped Operations Boundary

Chio now claims one bounded web3 operations contract only:

- one oracle runtime report under `arc.link.runtime-report.v1`
- one anchor runtime report under `chio.anchor-runtime-report.v1`
- one settlement runtime report under `chio.settle-runtime-report.v1`
- explicit indexer status classes: `healthy`, `lagging`, `drifted`,
  `replaying`, and `failed`
- explicit emergency modes that can narrow the writable runtime surface
  without widening trust or mutating prior signed Chio truth

- `target/web3-ops-qualification/runtime-reports/chio-settle-runtime-report.json`
- `target/web3-ops-qualification/control-state/chio-link-control-state.json`

Schema-reference examples remain checked in under `docs/standards/`:

- `docs/standards/CHIO_ANCHOR_RUNTIME_REPORT_EXAMPLE.json`
- `docs/standards/CHIO_SETTLE_RUNTIME_REPORT_EXAMPLE.json`

## Indexers And Drift

The shipped indexer model stays explicit and narrow:

- every runtime report names the operator-visible service or event processor
- indexer lag is measured against canonical chain or checkpoint head, not
  against optimistic local assumptions
- `drifted` means the service is materially behind or inconsistent and should
  not be treated as authoritative
- `replaying` means the service is intentionally rebuilding state against a
  canonical head after a reorg or rollback

## Emergency Controls

The shipped emergency-control posture is bounded:

- `chio-link` can globally pause conversion or disable specific pairs or chains
- `chio-anchor` can enter `publish_paused`, `proof_import_only`,
  `recovery_only`, or `halted` modes
- `chio-settle` can enter `dispatch_paused`, `refund_only`, `recovery_only`,
  or `halted` modes

These controls narrow write behavior only. They do not rewrite prior receipts,
proofs, or finality state. Qualification records the resulting control-state
snapshots and append-only control traces so operators can audit who changed
runtime posture, when, and from which incident or drill source.

## Generated Qualification Outputs

The primary live evidence is generated, not handwritten:

- local qualification writes artifacts under `target/web3-ops-qualification/`
- hosted release qualification stages the same family under
  `target/release-qualification/web3-runtime/ops/`
- operators should use the generated reports, control-state snapshots, and
  control traces for incident review; the checked-in example JSON files are
  schema references only

## Failure Posture

Web3 operations fail closed by default.

Operators must not keep normal publication or dispatch open when:

- indexers are `drifted` or `failed`
- canonical-chain drift marks a settlement or anchor event as `reorged`
- anchor publication requires replay against a canonical root-registry head
- settlement recovery requires refund-first or manual replay posture

## Non-Goals

This profile does not yet claim:

- autonomous incident remediation without explicit operator posture changes
- cross-region replicated indexers or consensus-backed ops state
- permissionless public dashboards or unauthenticated incident feeds
- silent continuation when canonical chain history and indexed history diverge
