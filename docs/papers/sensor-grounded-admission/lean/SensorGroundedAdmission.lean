  Sensor-grounded admission: structural distinguishability of admission
  under attested healthy vs. attested degraded substrate state.

  This file is the paper-local mechanization of the four theorems the paper
  names. It is not imported by `Chio.lean`, not built by `lake build`, not
  listed in `formal/proof-manifest.toml`, and not in
  `formal/theorem-inventory.json`. It is checked by hand from
  `formal/lean4/Chio` with `lake env lean` against the current toolchain
  (`lean-toolchain`, v4.28.0). The imports below name the substrate modules
  the model sits beside; no declaration from them is used.

  The four theorems:

  1. `admission_predicate_separates_healthy_and_degraded_witnesses` (headline)
     - Existence-of-witnesses claim: for any constitution with a non-empty
       required set on a family with body-admitted receipt, there exist
       two attestations over the SAME canonical body that discharge
       admission to opposite verdicts.

  2. `partition_contingency_mode_iff_degraded_subset`
     - Biconditional between the Boolean ladder-mode tag and a
       proper-sublist relation: the attested-healthy entries are a
       sublist of the full required list, and the two lists differ.
       The proof uses `List.filter_sublist` for the sublist witness
       and `List.Sublist.eq_of_length` for the distinctness bridge in
       both directions.

  3. `healthy_attestation_required_for_destructive_admission`
     - Structural projection: if admission succeeds, the family has a
       required-set declaration and its coverage holds. Does not in
       fact use the `destructiveAdmissionFamily` hypothesis; STATUS.md
       records this.

  4. `degraded_sensor_admission_requires_re_admission_witness`
     - Amendment improvement: an attestation in partition contingency
       for the prior required set, admitted under the amended
       constitution, is no longer in partition contingency for the
       amended required set. The prior-mode premise and the new-mode
       conclusion together state the structural improvement.

  Theorem 1: headline existence-of-witnesses claim.
  --------------------------------------------------------------
-/

/--
  Headline theorem: the admission predicate separates a fixed healthy
  attestation witness from a fixed degraded attestation witness over a
  shared body, exhibiting two attestations that discharge admission to
  opposite verdicts.

  For any constitution `c` whose lookup yields a non-empty required-set
  declaration `decl` for family `f`, and any body `r` of family `f`
  that body-admits, there exist healthy and degraded attestations over
  `r` that discharge `admissibleUnderSensorState` to opposite verdicts.

  Construction: the healthy witness lists one healthy record per
  required entry, with zero drop/miss counts. The degraded witness is
  the empty provider list. The empty list fails the required-set
  coverage check whenever `decl.required` is non-empty; the per-entry
  healthy record list passes coverage by the support lemmas above.
  Both attestations satisfy `dropAndMissBounded` trivially (the
  healthy witness has zero counts everywhere, the degraded witness
  has no providers). The body predicates accept on `r` by hypothesis.

  Theorem 2: partition-contingency-mode as a proper-sublist witness.

  The mode flag is defined by a strict length inequality. The
  substantive content of the theorem is that this inequality is
  equivalent to a proper-sublist relation between the attested-healthy
  entries and the full required list: a sublist witness paired with a
  proof of distinctness. The forward direction uses
  `List.filter_sublist` to extract the sublist, and `List.Sublist`'s
  `eq_of_length` lemma to argue the lists must differ. The backward
  direction uses `Sublist.length_le` and the same `eq_of_length` lemma
  to derive the strict inequality from sublist plus distinctness.

  The attested-healthy entries are a sublist of the full required
  list: filtering preserves the inclusion relation.

/--
  Supporting theorem: the partition-contingency mode flag is true iff
  the attested-healthy entries are a proper sublist of the full
  required list (sublist witness plus list inequality).

  The proof composes `attestedHealthy_sublist` (from `filter_sublist`)
  with `Sublist.length_le` and `Sublist.eq_of_length` to bridge the
  strict length inequality with the proper-sublist relation. Neither
  direction is a one-step `decide`-elimination: the sublist witness
  has to be constructed (forward) or destructed (backward), and the
  list-distinctness argument requires the `eq_of_length` lemma in
  both directions.

  Theorem 4: amendment re-admission carries a partition-contingency
  improvement witness.

  The substantive content: an attestation that was in partition
  contingency for the prior required set, and that admits under the
  amended constitution, is no longer in partition contingency for the
  amended required set. Both premises (prior partition-contingency
  mode, current admission) appear in the conclusion's structural
  contrast: prior mode = true, current mode = false on the SAME
  attestation against the prior vs amended required sets. The
  amendment shrank the required substrate enough that the attestation
  now covers it.

  Supporting theorem: an amendment that re-admits a receipt previously
  admitted under partition contingency must carry a re-admission witness
  whose existing attestation is no longer in partition contingency for
  the amended required set. The premise `h_prev_partition` and the
  conclusion's `prev = true / next = false` contrast together state
  that the amendment is a structural improvement: the same attestation
  bytes that fell short of `declprev` cover `declnext` in full.

  The witness's `newAttestation` is the receipt's own attestation; the
  `amendedRequiredSet` is the new constitution's lookup; the
  `coverage` field is the projection of the amended admission. The
  structural improvement claim is the conjunction of the prior-mode
  hypothesis with the proof that the new mode is false on the amended
  declaration.
