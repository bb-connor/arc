# Receipt Dashboard Guide

The ARC receipt dashboard is a React SPA that visualizes the kernel's receipt log. It is served directly by the trust-control axum server from the `dashboard/dist/` directory.

## Building the Dashboard

```bash
cd crates/arc-cli/dashboard
npm install
npm run test
npm run build
```

The build output lands in `crates/arc-cli/dashboard/dist/`. The trust-control server serves the `dist/` directory as a static catch-all after all API routes. No separate web server is needed.

The dashboard has no dependency on the `siem` feature flag. It communicates with the trust-control server's existing HTTP API.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Start the trust-control server, then open `http://localhost:<port>/` in a browser. The server port is set in your ARC configuration.

### Authentication

All API calls from the dashboard require a Bearer token. The token is read in this order:

1. `sessionStorage` key `arc_token` (set from a previous visit)
2. URL query parameter `?token=<value>`

When a token is found in the URL it is moved to `sessionStorage` and removed from the URL bar (using `window.history.replaceState`) to prevent it from appearing in browser history or the `Referer` header.

Pass your service token on the initial URL:

```
http://localhost:7391/?token=my-service-token
```

After the first load the token is stored in `sessionStorage` for the session. Closing the tab clears it.
If no token is present, the dashboard shows an explicit operator guidance state instead of issuing unauthenticated API requests.

## Filtering Receipts

The left sidebar exposes the following filters:

- **Agent Subject**: hex-encoded Ed25519 public key; shows only receipts belonging to that agent's capability tokens
- **Tool Server**: exact match on the tool server name
- **Tool Name**: exact match on the tool name
- **Outcome**: `allow`, `deny`, `cancelled`, or `incomplete`
- **Since / Until**: Unix second timestamps for a time range

All filters map directly to the parameters on `GET /v1/receipts/query` (see `docs/RECEIPT_QUERY_API.md`). Changing any filter resets pagination to page 1. Results are shown 50 per page with Previous and Next pagination buttons backed by cursor-based pagination.

## Operator Report Summary

Above the receipt table, the dashboard renders a composed operator summary backed by `GET /v1/reports/operator`. It is not a client-side reconstruction over paged receipts. The summary cards surface:

- Activity totals for the filtered corpus
- Spend totals plus the top root subject in the attribution slice
- Budget pressure (`matchingGrants`, `nearLimitCount`, `exhaustedCount`)
- Compliance posture (`checkpointCoverageRate`, `lineageCoverageRate`, `uncheckpointedReceipts`)
- Settlement/export readiness (`pendingSettlementReceipts`, `failedSettlementReceipts`, proof completeness, and export-scope caveats)
- Shared remote evidence reference counts plus the latest referenced partner/share

This is the primary operator view for "is this agent/tool slice healthy and exportable right now?" The receipt table and detail panel remain the drill-down surface.

## Portable Reputation Comparison

When the **Agent Subject** filter is set, the dashboard also exposes a
portable comparison panel above the receipt table. Operators can upload a
passport JSON artifact and the dashboard will call
`POST /v1/reputation/compare/{subject_key}` on the trust-control service.

The panel renders:

- subject match vs mismatch between the live local subject key and the passport subject DID
- current local effective score and resolved tier
- optional relying-party acceptance state if the compared artifact already carries a verifier-evaluation result
- per-credential drift for composite score, reliability, delegation hygiene, and resource stewardship
- shared-evidence provenance for the local subject, including partner/share IDs,
  remote capability IDs, local anchor capability IDs, and local receipt counts

This keeps the browser on the same comparison contract already used by
`arc reputation compare --control-url ...`; the dashboard does not invent a
second local scoring path.

## Shared Evidence API Surface

Trust-control now also exposes `GET /v1/federation/evidence-shares`, which
returns the same shared-evidence report shape used inside operator reports and
portable reputation comparison. The CLI wrapper is:

```bash
arc trust evidence-share list --agent-subject <subject-hex> --json
```

This surfaces imported remote evidence references directly without merging
foreign receipts into native local receipt history.

## Receipt Detail Panel

Clicking any row in the receipt table opens a detail panel on the right. The panel shows:

- Decision badge (Allow / Deny / Cancelled / Incomplete)
- Tool server and tool name
- Formatted timestamp
- Full capability ID
- Financial metadata (if present): cost charged, budget remaining, total budget, delegation depth, and settlement status, all formatted from minor units
- Agent subject key (when attribution metadata is present)
- Cost over Time sparkline (per-day cost aggregated by the backend analytics API for the receipt subject)
- Delegation chain view (fetched from `GET /v1/lineage/{capability_id}/chain`)
- Raw tool call parameters
- Full receipt JSON

## Delegation Chain View

The `DelegationChain` component fetches from `GET /v1/lineage/{capability_id}/chain` and renders each `CapabilitySnapshot` in the chain from root to leaf. Each snapshot shows `subject_key`, `issuer_key`, `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `delegation_depth`, and the raw grants JSON. This allows operators to trace exactly how a capability was delegated and attenuated before reaching the agent.

## Budget Sparkline

The `BudgetSparkline` component is shown in the detail panel when the selected receipt has financial metadata. It is backed by `GET /v1/receipts/analytics?agentSubject=...&timeBucket=day`, using the receipt's attribution subject key (or the capability lineage fallback when attribution metadata is absent). The chart is rendered with lightweight inline SVG rather than a charting framework, which keeps the dashboard bundle small while still giving operators a useful spend trend.
