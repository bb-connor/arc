## Executive Summary

NIST AI RMF 1.0 is a voluntary framework organized around four core functions: Govern (organizational culture and policies), Map (context and risk identification), Measure (risk analysis and tracking), and Manage (risk prioritization and response). The framework is process-oriented and requires both organizational and technical controls. Chio supplies technical controls for the tool-invocation boundary of an agent system and produces signed, tamper-evident evidence that can be referenced by an organization's AI risk program.

Chio's strongest NIST AI RMF contribution is to Map and Manage. Capability tokens, scoped grants, delegation chains, the guard pipeline, budgets, and per-invocation signed receipts map directly to context identification, third-party management, and risk-response controls. Chio also supplies the raw data a Measure function needs (denial rates, budget velocity, guard-evidence frequency, DPoP attribution), though the risk-scoring layer itself is not yet shipped and is tracked separately as the proposed `chio-risk` crate. Govern subcategories are largely organizational and sit outside Chio's boundary; Chio contributes where policy-as-code, executable policy hashes in receipts, and workload identity touch organizational artifacts.

This mapping covers every Govern/Map/Measure/Manage subcategory in AI RMF 1.0. Subcategories that depend on organizational processes (workforce composition, leadership commitment, communications to stakeholders) are marked customer-responsibility and do not claim Chio coverage.

## Coverage Legend

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| strong | Chio's shipped controls directly implement the subcategory at the tool-governance layer |
| partial | Chio provides relevant evidence or partial enforcement; additional organizational work is required |
| customer-responsibility | The subcategory is organizational or process-level; Chio does not implement it |
| out-of-scope | The subcategory addresses concerns outside Chio's governance boundary (e.g., model training, workforce) |

## Gaps Summary

Items flagged as gaps or customer-responsibility that warrant reviewer attention:

1. Measure function is the weakest. Chio has the raw data but no risk scoring module. The proposed `chio-risk` crate (tracked in `docs/protocols/COMPLIANCE-ROADMAP.md` section 4.3) would close MP-5.1, MS-3.1, MS-4.3.
2. Global kill-switch (MG-2.2) is referenced in the roadmap but not yet shipped.
3. Residual-risk tracking (MG-1.4) has no structured representation in Chio artifacts.
4. Fairness, bias, environmental impact (MS-2.9, MS-2.10, MS-2.11, MS-2.12) are out of scope at the tool-governance layer.
5. Govern subcategories concerning workforce and leadership (GV-2.2, GV-2.3, GV-3.1, GV-3.2) are customer-responsibility and not implementable in code.
