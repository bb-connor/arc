## Executive Summary

PCI DSS v4.0 protects cardholder data (CHD) and sensitive authentication data (SAD) across people, processes, and technology. ARC (Provable Agent Capability Transport) does not itself process, store, or transmit cardholder data. However, agent systems governed by ARC frequently call payment gateways, CRMs that hold card data, or internal financial tool servers. ARC's role is to reduce the PCI DSS scope of the agent layer by enforcing that agents can only reach specific tools, under specific conditions, with tamper-evident attribution for every call.

ARC's strongest PCI DSS contributions are to Requirements 7, 8, and 10 (access by business need, user identification and authentication, logging and monitoring). Every tool invocation produces a signed `ArcReceipt`; batches are Merkle-committed via `KernelCheckpoint`; capability tokens carry scope, expiry, and delegation chains that map to role-based access; DPoP proof-of-possession binds each call to an agent keypair. Requirements 1, 5, 9, and 12 are organizational or network-layer concerns and are out of scope for ARC as a protocol. Requirements 3, 4, 6, and 11 have partial coverage with customer follow-through needed (for example, enforcing minimum TLS version and redacting guard evidence before persistence).

This mapping covers all 12 requirement groups with coverage level, gaps, and customer responsibility. It is intended as an input to a PCI DSS Report on Compliance (RoC) or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) scoping exercise for an agent-layer deployment built on ARC.

## Coverage Legend

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| strong | ARC's shipped controls directly satisfy the requirement at the agent tool-governance layer |
| partial | ARC supplies part of the control; configuration or additional components are required |
| customer-responsibility | The requirement is organizational, physical, or network-layer; ARC does not implement it |
| out-of-scope | The requirement does not apply to the tool-governance layer |

## Gaps Summary

Items that require additional ARC work or customer effort:

1. **Req 3.4 PAN redaction patterns.** `response_sanitization.rs` supports pattern rules but ships no PAN-specific library. Customer must load a PAN regex set.
2. **Req 3.5 / 3.6 / 4.2.1 FIPS and key management.** The FIPS signing path and HSM backends (Vault Transit, AWS KMS) are tracked in `docs/protocols/COMPLIANCE-ROADMAP.md` section 2 but not yet shipped.
3. **Req 4.2 `min_tls_version`.** The option is planned but not currently enforced inside `KernelConfig`. HTTP termination layer must enforce TLS 1.2 minimum.
4. **Req 6.3 Vulnerability disclosure policy.** Not published in-tree.
5. **Req 10.6 NTP.** Host-level concern; kernel relies on system clock.
6. **Req 11.4 Pen-testing.** Not automated.
7. **Guard evidence redaction.** Listed P1 in the compliance roadmap; the store may persist post-invocation guard snippets that could contain PAN if not configured.

Customer-responsibility items that implementers must not assume ARC provides:

- Req 1 (network security), Req 5 (anti-malware), Req 9 (physical access), Req 12 (policy/training/IR program) in full.
