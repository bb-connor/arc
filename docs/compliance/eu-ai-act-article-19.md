## Executive Summary

The EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) imposes logging, traceability, and technical documentation requirements on providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems. Article 19 specifically requires high-risk AI systems to automatically generate logs of their operation, with sufficient detail for post-hoc accountability and oversight. Annex IV extends this to require technical documentation that describes the system's design, capabilities, and monitoring procedures. Chio satisfies these requirements through its cryptographically-signed receipt log, Merkle-committed checkpoint infrastructure, and configurable retention policy.

Every tool invocation processed by the Chio kernel produces a signed `ChioReceipt` -- a tamper-evident log entry containing the capability identifier, tool server, tool name, invocation parameters hash, decision (allow or deny), policy hash, and a kernel key reference. Receipts are appended to an SQLite log in sequence order and are periodically committed into Merkle checkpoint batches, each signed by the kernel's Ed25519 keypair. This provides a tamper-evident, automatically-generated operation log that satisfies Article 19(1)'s traceability requirement without requiring any manual recording by operators or users.

Annex IV Section 2(g) requires that records be retained for a specified period and remain accessible for post-hoc review. Chio's `RetentionConfig` on `KernelConfig` provides configurable `retention_days` (default 90 days) and `max_size_bytes` (default 10 GB) for time-based and size-based rotation. Archived receipts are moved to a separate SQLite file and continue to verify against stored Merkle checkpoint roots in the archive database -- satisfying the requirement that records remain verifiable after archival. The DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession) module adds per-invocation cryptographic binding between the invoking agent's keypair and each specific tool call, providing Article 14-compatible human oversight anchors and ensuring that agent actions are attributable to the registered entity that holds the capability token.

## Clause Mapping

| Article/Annex | Requirement Summary | Chio Mechanism | Test File | Test Function |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Article 19(1) -- Automatic logging | High-risk AI systems must automatically generate logs of their operation for the period appropriate to the intended purpose | Signed `ChioReceipt` appended automatically for every tool invocation (allow or deny); no manual recording required | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `all_calls_produce_verified_receipts` |
| Article 19(1) -- Traceability of AI system actions | Logs must enable traceability of the AI system's actions during the system's lifetime | Receipt log links `capability_id`, `tool_server`, `tool_name`, `decision`, `policy_hash`, and `parameter_hash` in every record; `kernel_persists_tool_receipts_to_sqlite_store` confirms durable persistence | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `kernel_persists_tool_receipts_to_sqlite_store` |
| Article 19(1) -- Denial traceability | Logs must record denied operations with sufficient detail for audit | Deny `ChioReceipt` is signed and persisted with the same fields as allow; monetary denials carry `FinancialReceiptMetadata.attempted_cost` | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `monetary_denial_receipt_contains_financial_metadata` |
| Article 19(2) -- Logging capability description | Technical documentation must describe the logging capabilities of the system | `ToolManifest` with signed `ToolDefinition` per tool including human-readable description and parameter schema; manifest verification via Ed25519 signature | `crates/chio-manifest/src/lib.rs` | `sign_and_verify_manifest` |
| Annex IV Section 2(g) -- Record retention | Records must be retained for a period appropriate to the intended purpose; default minimum is 10 years for certain high-risk systems | `RetentionConfig.retention_days` (default 90, configurable) controls time-based rotation; operators set the retention period to match their regulatory obligation | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/retention.rs` | `retention_rotates_at_time_boundary` |
| Annex IV Section 2(g) -- Size-based rotation | Storage management must not lose records; size-based triggers must archive, not delete | `RetentionConfig.max_size_bytes` (default 10 GB) triggers archival (not deletion) of older receipts when the live DB exceeds the threshold | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/retention.rs` | `retention_rotates_at_size_boundary` |
| Annex IV Section 2(g) -- Records verifiable after archival | Archived records must remain verifiable and accessible for review | Archived receipts verify against Merkle checkpoint roots stored in the archive DB; `verify_checkpoint_signature` confirms the checkpoint signature is authentic in the archive | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/retention.rs` | `archived_receipt_verifies_against_checkpoint` |
| Annex IV Section 2(g) -- Checkpoint integrity in archive | Checkpoints must accompany their receipt batches in the archive | Archival logic copies checkpoint rows whose `batch_end_seq` is fully covered by archived receipts (partial-batch exclusion); batch 2 checkpoint remains in live DB when only batch 1 is archived | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/retention.rs` | `archive_preserves_checkpoint_rows` |
| Annex IV Section 7 -- Monitoring: tamper-evident audit | Technical documentation must describe measures ensuring log integrity; tamper-evident storage is required | Merkle-committed receipt batches: each batch of receipts produces a signed `KernelCheckpoint` with a Merkle root; checkpoint signature is verified via Ed25519 over canonical JSON | `crates/chio-kernel/src/checkpoint.rs` | `build_checkpoint_signature_verifies` |
| Annex IV Section 7 -- Individual receipt inclusion proof | Any individual log entry must be provably included in the audit record | Merkle inclusion proofs via `build_inclusion_proof` allow verifying any single receipt against the stored checkpoint root without re-reading the full batch | `crates/chio-kernel/src/checkpoint.rs` | `inclusion_proof_verifies_for_leaf_n` |
| Annex IV Section 7 -- Checkpoint trigger cadence | Logs must be committed at sufficient frequency for meaningful oversight | `checkpoint_batch_size` (default 100) controls how frequently Merkle checkpoints are triggered; `checkpoint_triggers_at_100_receipts` confirms the trigger fires at the configured batch size | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `checkpoint_triggers_at_100_receipts` |
| Annex IV Section 7 -- End-to-end inclusion proof via receipt store | Inclusion proofs must be reproducible from persisted receipt data | `inclusion_proof_verifies_against_stored_checkpoint` confirms that receipts loaded from the SQLite store produce valid inclusion proofs against the stored checkpoint root | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `inclusion_proof_verifies_against_stored_checkpoint` |
| Article 14 -- Human oversight: attributable decisions | Systems must enable human oversight; every decision must be attributable to the acting entity and to the policy applied | `ChioReceipt.decision` (Allow/Deny) combined with `policy_hash` and `capability_id` provides a signed, attributable audit record for every decision; receipt is signed by kernel keypair | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `all_calls_produce_verified_receipts` |
| Article 14 -- Human oversight: proof of possession | Oversight requires that agent actions are bound to the registered entity | DPoP Ed25519 proof binds `capability_id + tool_server + tool_name + action_hash + nonce` to the agent's registered keypair; `proof.body.agent_key` must equal `capability.subject` | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/dpop.rs` | `dpop_valid_proof_accepted` |
| Article 14 -- Human oversight: replay prevention | Actions must not be replayed; each logged action must be unique | DPoP `action_hash` (SHA-256 of canonical invocation arguments) prevents cross-invocation replay; nonce store prevents same-invocation replay within TTL window | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/dpop.rs` | `dpop_nonce_replay_within_ttl_rejected` |
| Article 14 -- Agent identity binding | Oversight measures must verify that the recorded agent identity is authentic | `dpop_wrong_agent_key_rejected` confirms that a proof signed by a different keypair than `capability.subject` is rejected before any action is taken | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/dpop.rs` | `dpop_wrong_agent_key_rejected` |
| Article 14 -- Freshness of oversight evidence | Stale or replayed oversight evidence must be rejected | DPoP proof `issued_at` is checked against kernel clock; proofs older than `proof_ttl_secs` (default 5 min) are rejected | `crates/chio-kernel/tests/dpop.rs` | `dpop_expired_proof_rejected` |
| Article 9 -- Risk management: budget accountability | Risk management systems must include controls on monetary resource consumption by AI systems | `FinancialReceiptMetadata` (`cost_charged`, `attempted_cost`, `settlement_status`) is attached to every receipt involving a monetary `ToolGrant`; `max_total_cost` and `max_cost_per_invocation` are enforced atomically | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `monetary_full_pipeline_three_invocations_third_denied` |
| Article 9 -- Risk management: monetary allow evidence | Receipts for allowed monetary actions must record actual cost | Allow receipts carry `FinancialReceiptMetadata.cost_charged` reflecting the actual cost reported by the tool server | `crates/chio-kernel/src/lib.rs` | `monetary_allow_receipt_contains_financial_metadata` |
