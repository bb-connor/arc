# GA Checklist

Use this checklist before claiming general-availability readiness for the
current post-`v2.41` ARC production candidate.

This checklist is procedural. Use
[RELEASE_AUDIT.md](RELEASE_AUDIT.md) for the authoritative repo-local
release-go decision,
[RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md](RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md) for supported scope, and
[QUALIFICATION.md](QUALIFICATION.md) for the required evidence lanes.
