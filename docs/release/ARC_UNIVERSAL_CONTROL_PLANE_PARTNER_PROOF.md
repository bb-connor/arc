# ARC Universal Control-Plane Partner Proof

## Reviewer Summary

ARC now qualifies a stronger technical claim than the earlier bounded-fabric
gate:

- ARC is a cryptographically signed, fail-closed, intent-aware governance
  control plane across the qualified authoritative HTTP, MCP, OpenAI, A2A, and
  ACP surfaces.

This document is the reviewer-facing proof package for that claim. It does not
assert that ARC has already proven market dominance or a comptroller-of-the-
agent-economy position.

## What Is Proved

- target routing is explicit or registry-derived rather than hidden behind
  edge-local defaults
- authoritative execution can preserve signed multi-hop route evidence and
  receipt lineage across more than one protocol boundary
- route planning is dynamic and intent-aware instead of static bridge metadata
- lifecycle semantics are derived from one shared contract on the
  claim-eligible surfaces
- compatibility helpers remain isolated from the technical claim boundary

## What Is Not Proved

- a proved comptroller-of-the-agent-economy market position
- ecosystem-wide universal partner adoption beyond the currently qualified
  surfaces and documented operator boundaries

## Evidence Package

The authoritative machine-readable decision is:

- [ARC_UNIVERSAL_CONTROL_PLANE_QUALIFICATION_MATRIX.json](../standards/ARC_UNIVERSAL_CONTROL_PLANE_QUALIFICATION_MATRIX.json)

The authoritative command is:

- `./scripts/qualify-universal-control-plane.sh`

The artifact bundle root is:

- `target/release-qualification/universal-control-plane/`

## Review Flow

1. Confirm the matrix decision is
   `technical_claim_qualified_market_thesis_not_yet_qualified`.
2. Confirm the runbook and report agree on the same claim boundary.
3. Inspect the logs for:
   - shared fabric and multi-hop route behavior
   - shared kernel-backed HTTP authority behavior
   - claim-surface and planning-state consistency
4. Confirm the older bounded-fabric gate remains available as the prerequisite
   lower-level substrate proof.

## Boundary Examples

Representative authoritative routes now covered by the technical claim:

- HTTP -> kernel authority -> native tool execution
- OpenAI tool call -> kernel route selection -> native tool execution
- A2A -> MCP -> native execution with route evidence
- ACP -> MCP -> native execution with route evidence

These examples are sufficient to prove the shared control-plane pattern across
the currently qualified protocol families. They are not a claim that every
possible future partner ecosystem or protocol family is already integrated.
