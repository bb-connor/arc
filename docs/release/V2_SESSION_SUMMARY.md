# Chio v2.0 Agent Economy Foundation -- Session Summary

## What We Built

Transformed Chio from a v1.0 security protocol into the economic infrastructure for autonomous agent systems. In a single autonomous session, we executed 5 phases (8-12), ran 3 rounds of security audits with full remediation, and produced comprehensive documentation.

### Milestone: v2.0 Agent Economy Foundation

**Scope:** 6 phases (7-12), 19 plans, 22 requirements, 123 commits
**Codebase:** 10 Rust crates, 69K lines of Rust, 3.5K lines of TypeScript, 461+ tests
**Tag:** `v2.0`

## Phases Executed

### Phase 7: Schema Compatibility and Monetary Foundation
- Removed `deny_unknown_fields` from 18 chio-core types for forward compatibility
- Added `MonetaryAmount` (u64 minor-units), `max_cost_per_invocation`/`max_total_cost` on `ToolGrant`
- Added `ReduceCostPerInvocation`/`ReduceTotalCost` attenuation variants
- Plans: `.planning/phases/07-schema-compatibility-and-monetary-foundation/`

### Phase 8: Core Enforcement
- `try_charge_cost` with atomic SQLite IMMEDIATE transactions
- `FinancialReceiptMetadata` on receipts (11 fields: cost, currency, budget tracking, settlement)
- Merkle-committed receipt batches with signed `KernelCheckpoint` structs
- `VelocityGuard` with synchronous token bucket rate limiting
- HA overrun bound documented and tested (`max_cost_per_invocation * node_count`)
- Plans: `.planning/phases/08-core-enforcement/`

### Phase 9: Compliance and DPoP
- DPoP proof-of-possession (Chio-native Ed25519 canonical JSON, not HTTP-shaped)
- LRU nonce replay store with configurable TTL (5-min default)
- Receipt retention with time-based (90-day) and size-based (10GB) rotation
- Colorado SB 24-205 compliance mapping (16 clause-to-test references)
- EU AI Act Article 19 compliance mapping (19 clause-to-test references)
- Plans: `.planning/phases/09-compliance-and-dpop/`

### Phase 10: Receipt Query API and TypeScript SDK 1.0
- Receipt query API with 8-dimension filtering and cursor-based pagination
- HTTP endpoint: `GET /v1/receipts/query` on trust-control axum server
- CLI: `chio receipt list` with JSON Lines output and 10 filter flags
- TypeScript SDK hardened to `@chio-protocol/sdk@1.0.0`
- `signDpopProof` with canonical JSON matching Rust `DpopProofBody` exactly
- `ReceiptQueryClient` with `query()` and `paginate()` async generator
- Plans: `.planning/phases/10-receipt-query-api-and-typescript-sdk-1-0/`

### Phase 11: SIEM Integration
- New `chio-siem` crate behind `--features siem` flag
- Splunk HEC exporter (newline-separated JSON, HEC token auth, TLS enforced)
- Elasticsearch bulk exporter (NDJSON, API key + Basic auth, partial failure detection)
- `ExporterManager` with cursor-pull loop, exponential backoff, bounded DLQ
- Kernel TCB isolation verified (no HTTP client deps in chio-kernel)
- Plans: `.planning/phases/11-siem-integration/`

### Phase 12: Capability Lineage Index and Receipt Dashboard
- `capability_lineage` SQLite table with snapshot persistence at issuance time
- `WITH RECURSIVE` CTE for delegation chain walks (depth guard < 20)
- Agent-centric receipt queries via `LEFT JOIN` on `capability_lineage`
- Receipt dashboard SPA (React 18 / Vite 6 / TanStack Table 8 / Recharts 2)
- Served via axum `tower_http::ServeDir`, Bearer token auth
- Plans: `.planning/phases/12-capability-lineage-index-and-receipt-dashboard/`

## Security Audit and Remediation

Three rounds of security audit with parallel agent teams, producing 22 fix commits.

### Round 1: Initial Audit (5 agents)
Identified 25 issues across Rust, TypeScript, and documentation. All fixed:
- DPoP nonce mutex poisoning -- fail-closed error handling
- Budget overflow -- `checked_add` replacing `saturating_add`
- Receipt query outcome validation
- Splunk HEC TLS enforcement
- Elasticsearch password `Zeroizing<String>`
- Checkpoint co-archival verification
- VelocityGuard integer milli-token arithmetic (replaced f64)
- SIEM persistent SQLite connection
- Dashboard bearer token stripped from URL via `replaceState`
- CSP headers on axum-served dashboard
- 7 new operational guides + 3 doc updates

### Round 2: Verification Pass (3 agents)
Re-audited all fixes. Confirmed correct. Found 1 minor gap (SDK `agentSubject` type). Fixed.

### Round 3: Deep Dive (4 agents -- Opus-level analysis)
Found 7 additional issues in the evaluate pipeline:
- **DPoP check reordered before budget charge** -- prevents budget drain attack
- **Nested-flow path now propagates charge_result** -- FinancialReceiptMetadata on all receipts
- **budget_remaining uses cumulative cost** -- accurate audit trail
- **Monetary denial receipt budget_total fixed** -- no longer shows 0
- **Production panic! replaced with error propagation**
- **dpop_required enforced in is_subset_of** -- delegation can't drop DPoP
- **6 edge case tests added** (empty budget, zero cost, DPoP u64::MAX, single-receipt Merkle, no-checkpoint archive, cursor u64::MAX)

Plus protocol spec additions, 4 ADRs, migration guide, and changelog.
