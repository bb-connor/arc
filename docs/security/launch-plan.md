# Security roadmap execution and launch ledger

## Release contract

Deliver the existing protocol-primitives, active-defense, and enterprise-hardening
roadmap as one integrated candidate. Publish qualified Rust crates and a confined
Linux developer preview with automatic response disabled. Complete a separate
observed internal engineering pilot before promoting reversible containment.

The enforced native profile is one operator with authoritative durable state on
Linux x86_64, kernel 6.7 or newer, and every cage prerequisite verified. Portable
verification has its own platform evidence. Distributed-linearizable authority,
mobile hardware qualification, other native sandboxes, customer hosting, and
economic-product expansion are follow-up profiles, not preview claims.

The source contracts remain:

- [Protocol primitives](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-protocol-primitives.md)
- [Active defense](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-security-active-defense.md)
- [Enterprise hardening](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-enterprise-hardening.md)
- [Operational promotion](active-defense-rollout.md)

## Candidate and evidence rules

Integration starts from main `f5566d9a765c21cb36652a99c79de64968a656bf`
and includes security source `c85ef77b08ddcb52c9120f8b9a5c8b85532b98b4`.
The security source is a direct descendant of that main revision; all 50 commits
were fast-forwarded into the isolated `security/launch-integration` branch.
Existing working trees remain unchanged.

Evidence states are independent: implemented, locally verified, hosted-qualified,
and operationally qualified. A source change invalidates evidence for its affected
input closure. A passing metadata validator does not reproduce a mutation campaign.
Skipped platform probes do not qualify that platform. Report source SHA, command,
executed test inventory, artifacts, tool versions, and hosted run attempt together.

No row below claims hosted or operational qualification for the integrated source.

## Requirement ledger

`Present` means implementation was carried into the candidate and still needs
requirement-specific qualification. Task and phase references cover the complete
original plans; individual defects and evidence are recorded below this table.

| Arc / original requirement | Candidate state | Required evidence / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol 0: characterize existing authority | Present | Existing budget, approval, and receipt regressions |
| Protocol 1: signed aggregate root and negotiation | Present | Issuance, attenuation, root substitution, unsupported-feature rejection |
| Protocol 2: composite holds and durable stores | Present | Concurrent grant/family/broker admission, restart, atomic revocation/capture |
| Protocol 2: admission ordering and terminal projection | Present | Crash matrix and original operation identity across recovery |
| Protocol 3: policy-owned threshold and signer set | Present | Exact action/capability/policy binding, duplicate signers, expiry |
| Protocol 3: durable replay, collection and federation compatibility | Partially integrated | Replay stores are present; reconcile the two collector APIs, then qualify restart, concurrent consumption and preserved bilateral semantics |
| Protocol 4: bounded runtime evidence | Present | Existing proof-parity and no-bypass contracts; no broader proof claim |
| Protocol 5: schemas, bindings, adapter preservation | Present | Registry, canonical vectors, four-language codegen and bridge parity |

| Active defense 3: durable security stores | Present | Transactional transitions, isolation epochs, restart and outage tests |
| Active defense 4: flow and one-shot declassification | Present | Principal/lineage persistence, complete-source binding, egress fences |
| Active defense 5: kernel adapters and composition | Present | Every opted-in path installs complete authority or rejects |
| Active defense 6: private deception and tripwires | Present | Marker privacy, lifecycle recovery, deny before dispatch/delivery |
| Active defense 7: temporal correlation | Present | Trusted event provenance, bounded lateness, deterministic replay |
| Active defense 8: affected sets and approvals | Present | Exact lineage under issuance fences; action-bound approval |
| Active defense 8: effects and rollback | Present | Partial failure, overlapping restrictions, stale workers, truthful receipts |

| Active defense 11: migration and promotion | Tools present; pilot pending | Verified backfill, observed shadow window, reviewed precision, signed stages |
| Enterprise 0: source and enforcement-stack audit | Present | Provenance, pinned dependencies, actual x86_64 Linux runner |
| Enterprise 1: RFC 6962 consistency | Present | Independent vectors and malformed-proof rejection |
| Enterprise 2-3: key log, witnessed rotation, verification | Present | Contiguous replay, strict-majority witnesses, fenced signing, rollback refusal |
| Enterprise 4-5: broker authorization, custody and execution | Present | No secret crossing, exact destination, shared quotas, durable reconciliation |
| Enterprise 6-8: retained resources, cage-init and supervision | Present | Actual Landlock/seccomp/exec probes, helper/FD/path mutation cases |
| Enterprise 9: production composition and receipts | Present in components | Integrated provider-backed invocation and failure/recovery evidence |
| Enterprise 10: schemas, adversarial evidence and migration | Pending qualification | Exact Linux capture, signed evidence, one-way migration, no fallback |
| Developer API and distribution | Pending | Packaged dependency closure and external Rust consumer |
| Confined reference runtime | Pending | Supervision, preflight, compiled tools, clean-machine installation |
| Observed internal pilot | Not started | Existing 14-day/100,000-invocation or 30-day window and finding review |

## Work sequence

1. Integrate, reconcile the historical security PR, diagnose baseline gate failures,
   and establish the complete candidate evidence inventory.
2. Close supported authority, flow, custody, confinement, and recovery seams with
   regression tests against the actual production boundaries.
3. Package the existing runtime and daemons with dedicated service identities,
   readiness checks, durable state, and a confined internal engineering swarm.
4. Qualify the Rust entrypoints `chio-kernel-core`, `chio-kernel`, and
   `chio-swarm-authority` and their production dependency closure outside the
   workspace. Use the next unused `0.2.0-alpha.N` package version independently
   of wire schema versions.
5. Publish the developer preview through the existing operator-controlled release
   mechanism after exact-candidate qualification. Automatic response stays off.
6. Run the observed internal pilot and the staged promotion contract. Retain real
   workload findings separately from injected attacks. Insufficient evidence
   leaves promotion pending; permanent revocation stays manual.

## Baseline findings

- Main CI run `33717023565` passed, but Release Qualification run `33717023364`
  failed on the same main SHA. The first failing gate reports duplicate function
  identity `validate_permissions` in the hosted-edge TLS source. Missing formal
  proof-report and web3 artifacts are downstream failures, not completed gates.
- The integrated threat ledger contains 20 partial rows. Its metadata checks
  passed on the original security source. Full threat closure is not claimed.
- The original security source passed 64 swarm-authority tests, 42 flow tests,
  and 16 response-authority tests. Two process helpers are intentionally ignored
  during ordinary enumeration and invoked by the process-boundary test.
- This development host is Linux aarch64. It cannot produce the required native
  x86_64 cage-enforcement release evidence.

## Integration closeout, 2026-09-04

Completed source changes in this integration worktree:

- Preserved hosted-edge TLS permission and file-identity behavior while giving
  each platform-specific helper one source-level function identity.
- Extended the structured adapter checker through literal `include!` source
  graphs, independent of filename extension. Exceptions retain physical file and
  function identity. Missing, cyclic, excessive-depth, dynamic, escaping, and
  symlinked includes reject. Test-only includes are excluded by attributes, not
  solely by their filenames. Arbitrary Rust macro expansion is not proved.
- Registered the exact MCP supervision threads without exempting side effects in
  their closures. Added native-launch contracts for manifest reauthorization,
  enterprise migration, and propagated authorization before direct spawn.
- Updated both evidence-container Cargo.lock pins to
  `2a66cf73b8fbc3bb740585ddb66bc96b24f71c4012b29681682f663261f6d928`.
  Relative to the previous pin's commit `c8c282427e`, the delta adds the internal
  response-authority and shared-IPC packages and updates workspace dependency
  edges. No third-party package version or checksum changes in that delta.
- Separated validated threshold records into `approval/collector.rs`, preserving
  the public `chio_kernel::approval` paths. Reduced `approval.rs` from 2,584 to
  1,763 lines. Added public API contract tests.
- Reproduced and fixed acceptance of a persisted satisfaction timestamp before
  receipt of a quorum. The validator now requires enough distinct, verified votes
  at the recorded time; later surplus votes remain valid.
- Separated control-plane diagnostic projection into `error.rs`, preserving
  `chio_control_plane::CliError`. The crate root is 937 lines; its obsolete
  size exception was removed, with no other caps increased or renewed.

Source checkpoints:

- `ccc11df414`: integrated release source checks, TLS helpers and evidence lock pin.
- `42cb55260d`: approval-record separation, causal validation and regression tests.
- `3c4e9a935c`: stable diagnostic projection separation and public API tests.

Local verification completed so far:

| Command / boundary | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p xtask --bin xtask adapter_no_bypass` | 19 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo xtask check adapter-no-bypass` | Integrated production source contracts passed |
| `cargo test -p chio-finding-hosted-edge --lib tls::tests` | 7 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-store-sqlite --test approval_store --test governed_approval_kernel_replay` | 8 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel --test threshold_approval_records` | 8 passed, zero ignored; causal timestamp regression failed before the fix |
| `cargo test -p chio-control-plane --test error_projection` | 2 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo clippy -p xtask -p chio-kernel -p chio-control-plane -p chio-finding-hosted-edge --lib --bins -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Passed |
| Adapter wrapper and Rust file-hygiene self-tests | Passed; the full inherited hygiene inventory remains red |
| `cargo xtask gen proof-coverage --check` after regeneration | 58 rows and 166 artifacts match; no new proof campaign claimed |
| `python3 scripts/check-security-ci-contract.py` and its self-tests | Passed, including trust-boundary mutation rejection |
| Security and enterprise provenance, Linux dependency-stack inventory | Passed; inventory checks do not assert real kernel enforcement |
| `bash scripts/check-security-dependencies.sh` | Passed against resolved Cargo metadata |
| Rust public-surface policy | Passed; packages remain unpublished |

Open local closeout work:

- The inherited integration exceeded 26 Rust file-size caps. The two module
  separations above remove two violations. The remaining 24 need coherent
  decomposition and behavioral qualification; the full hygiene gate is still red.
- `ApprovalStore` exposes validated-record collector methods whose default
  implementations deny as unavailable. SQLite currently implements the distinct
  `ThresholdApprovalCollectorStore` API from `threshold_approval.rs`. The new record
  tests are not proof that these APIs are composed. Reconcile authority ownership,
  authenticated current-context loading, routes, persistence and callers before
  stabilizing or advertising durable collector coverage.
- Keep proof-coverage inventory synchronized as the remaining source layout is
  decomposed. The current inventory is refreshed; a new formal proof campaign
  remains separate work.
- Rerun all affected behavioral and full workspace gates, then obtain exact-head
  hosted qualification. No container image, native campaign, or pilot was launched
  by these local checks. Automatic response remains unpromoted.

## Engineering acceptance

Use existing ports, validated types, opaque verified authority, checked arithmetic,
explicit state transitions, and RAII for resource custody. Keep unsafe operations
inside reviewed OS boundary modules with safety invariants. Production domain and
orchestration code must not add unsafe, unwrap, or expect. Security errors deny;
enforced configurations never fall back to legacy paths.

Run focused behavioral tests per change and the original complete security,
schema, formal, dependency, workspace, and release gates before promotion. Every
required filtered gate asserts nonzero execution. Negative controls must fail for
the intended reason; unavailable infrastructure is not evidence of enforcement.

Completion requires qualified packages and runtime, observed pilot and selected
containment promotion, and claim-to-evidence mapping for every advertised
guarantee. Implementation completion, preview publication, hosted qualification,
and operational promotion remain distinct records.
