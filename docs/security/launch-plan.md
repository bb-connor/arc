# Security roadmap execution and launch ledger

## Release contract

Deliver the existing protocol-primitives, active-defense, and enterprise-hardening
roadmap as one integrated candidate. Publish qualified Rust crates and a confined
Linux developer preview with automatic response disabled. Complete a separate
observed internal engineering pilot before promoting reversible containment.

The enforced native profile is one operator with authoritative durable state on
Linux x86_64, kernel 6.7 or newer, and every cage prerequisite verified. Portable
verification has its own platform evidence. Distributed-linearizable authority,
mobile hardware qualification, other native sandboxes, customer hosting, and
economic-product expansion are follow-up profiles, not preview claims.

The source contracts remain:

- [Protocol primitives](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-protocol-primitives.md)
- [Active defense](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-security-active-defense.md)
- [Enterprise hardening](../superpowers/plans/2026-07-09-enterprise-hardening.md)
- [Operational promotion](active-defense-rollout.md)

## Candidate and evidence rules

Integration starts from main `f5566d9a765c21cb36652a99c79de64968a656bf`
and includes security source `c85ef77b08ddcb52c9120f8b9a5c8b85532b98b4`.
The security source is a direct descendant of that main revision; all 50 commits
were fast-forwarded into the isolated `security/launch-integration` branch.
Existing working trees remain unchanged.

Evidence states are independent: implemented, locally verified, hosted-qualified,
and operationally qualified. A source change invalidates evidence for its affected
input closure. A passing metadata validator does not reproduce a mutation campaign.
Skipped platform probes do not qualify that platform. Report source SHA, command,
executed test inventory, artifacts, tool versions, and hosted run attempt together.

No row below claims hosted or operational qualification for the integrated source.

## Requirement ledger

`Present` means implementation was carried into the candidate and still needs
requirement-specific qualification. Task and phase references cover the complete
original plans; individual defects and evidence are recorded below this table.

| Enterprise 9: production composition and receipts | Present in components | Integrated provider-backed invocation and failure/recovery evidence |
| Enterprise 10: schemas, adversarial evidence and migration | Pending qualification | Exact Linux capture, signed evidence, one-way migration, no fallback |
| Developer API and distribution | Pending | Packaged dependency closure and external Rust consumer |
| Confined reference runtime | Pending | Supervision, preflight, compiled tools, clean-machine installation |
| Observed internal pilot | Not started | Existing 14-day/100,000-invocation or 30-day window and finding review |

## Work sequence

1. Integrate, reconcile the historical security PR, diagnose baseline gate failures,
   and establish the complete candidate evidence inventory.
2. Close supported authority, flow, custody, confinement, and recovery seams with
   regression tests against the actual production boundaries.
3. Package the existing runtime and daemons with dedicated service identities,
   readiness checks, durable state, and a confined internal engineering swarm.
4. Qualify the Rust entrypoints `chio-kernel-core`, `chio-kernel`, and
   `chio-swarm-authority` and their production dependency closure outside the
   workspace. Use the next unused `0.2.0-alpha.N` package version independently
   of wire schema versions.
5. Publish the developer preview through the existing operator-controlled release
   mechanism after exact-candidate qualification. Automatic response stays off.
6. Run the observed internal pilot and the staged promotion contract. Retain real
   workload findings separately from injected attacks. Insufficient evidence
   leaves promotion pending; permanent revocation stays manual.

## Baseline findings

- Main CI run `33717023565` passed, but Release Qualification run `33717023364`
  failed on the same main SHA. The first failing gate reports duplicate function
  identity `validate_permissions` in the hosted-edge TLS source. Missing formal
  proof-report and web3 artifacts are downstream failures, not completed gates.
- The integrated threat ledger contains 20 partial rows. Its metadata checks
  passed on the original security source. Full threat closure is not claimed.
- The original security source passed 64 swarm-authority tests, 42 flow tests,
  and 16 response-authority tests. Two process helpers are intentionally ignored
  during ordinary enumeration and invoked by the process-boundary test.
- This development host is Linux aarch64. It cannot produce the required native
  x86_64 cage-enforcement release evidence.

## Integration closeout, 2026-09-04

Completed source changes in this integration worktree:

- Preserved hosted-edge TLS permission and file-identity behavior while giving
  each platform-specific helper one source-level function identity.
- Extended the structured adapter checker through literal `include!` source
  graphs, independent of filename extension. Exceptions retain physical file and
  function identity. Missing, cyclic, excessive-depth, dynamic, escaping, and
  symlinked includes reject. Test-only includes are excluded by attributes, not
  solely by their filenames. Arbitrary Rust macro expansion is not proved.
- Registered the exact MCP supervision threads without exempting side effects in
  their closures. Added native-launch contracts for manifest reauthorization,
  enterprise migration, and propagated authorization before direct spawn.
- Updated both evidence-container Cargo.lock pins to
  `2a66cf73b8fbc3bb740585ddb66bc96b24f71c4012b29681682f663261f6d928`.
  Relative to the previous pin's commit `c8c282427e`, the delta adds the internal
  response-authority and shared-IPC packages and updates workspace dependency
  edges. No third-party package version or checksum changes in that delta.
- Separated validated threshold records into `approval/collector.rs`, preserving
  the public `chio_kernel::approval` paths. Reduced `approval.rs` from 2,584 to
  1,763 lines. Added public API contract tests.
- Reproduced and fixed acceptance of a persisted satisfaction timestamp before
  receipt of a quorum. The validator now requires enough distinct, verified votes
  at the recorded time; later surplus votes remain valid.
- Separated control-plane diagnostic projection into `error.rs`, preserving
  `chio_control_plane::CliError`. The crate root is 937 lines; its obsolete
  size exception was removed, with no other caps increased or renewed.

Source checkpoints:

- `ccc11df414`: integrated release source checks, TLS helpers and evidence lock pin.
- `42cb55260d`: approval-record separation, causal validation and regression tests.
- `3c4e9a935c`: stable diagnostic projection separation and public API tests.

Local verification completed so far:

| Command / boundary | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p xtask --bin xtask adapter_no_bypass` | 19 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo xtask check adapter-no-bypass` | Integrated production source contracts passed |
| `cargo test -p chio-finding-hosted-edge --lib tls::tests` | 7 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-store-sqlite --test approval_store --test governed_approval_kernel_replay` | 8 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel --test threshold_approval_records` | 8 passed, zero ignored; causal timestamp regression failed before the fix |
| `cargo test -p chio-control-plane --test error_projection` | 2 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo clippy -p xtask -p chio-kernel -p chio-control-plane -p chio-finding-hosted-edge --lib --bins -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Passed |
| Adapter wrapper and Rust file-hygiene self-tests | Passed; the full inherited hygiene inventory remains red |
| `cargo xtask gen proof-coverage --check` after regeneration | 58 rows and 166 artifacts match; no new proof campaign claimed |
| `python3 scripts/check-security-ci-contract.py` and its self-tests | Passed, including trust-boundary mutation rejection |
| Security and enterprise provenance, Linux dependency-stack inventory | Passed; inventory checks do not assert real kernel enforcement |
| `bash scripts/check-security-dependencies.sh` | Passed against resolved Cargo metadata |
| Rust public-surface policy | Passed; packages remain unpublished |

Open local closeout work:

- The inherited integration exceeded 26 Rust file-size caps. The two module
  separations above remove two violations. The remaining 24 need coherent
  decomposition and behavioral qualification; the full hygiene gate is still red.
- `ApprovalStore` exposes validated-record collector methods whose default
  implementations deny as unavailable. SQLite currently implements the distinct
  `ThresholdApprovalCollectorStore` API from `threshold_approval.rs`. The new record
  tests are not proof that these APIs are composed. Reconcile authority ownership,
  authenticated current-context loading, routes, persistence and callers before
  stabilizing or advertising durable collector coverage.
- Keep proof-coverage inventory synchronized as the remaining source layout is
  decomposed. The current inventory is refreshed; a new formal proof campaign
  remains separate work.
- Rerun all affected behavioral and full workspace gates, then obtain exact-head
  hosted qualification. No container image, native campaign, or pilot was launched
  by these local checks. Automatic response remains unpromoted.

## Collector recovery closeout, 2026-09-05

The HTTP collector uses `ThresholdApprovalCollectorStore`; the validated-record
methods on `ApprovalStore` remain separate and unavailable by default. This slice
hardens the active collector's recovery boundary without adding another store API
or claiming that the two paths are composed.

Completed source changes:

- Revalidate restored proposal signatures, algorithm metadata, current policy and
  trusted authority before returning, updating, delivering, or cancelling a
  proposal. Reconstruct the eligible-set requirement, check the policy timeout
  upper bound, and enforce the stored separation-of-duties rule.
- Verify every retained original token, including expired history, against its
  signed proposal. Reject duplicate IDs, digests and approvers, mismatched signed
  bindings, invalid quorum/state chronology and regressing update timestamps.
  Historical reads and replacement of an expired vote retain their existing
  behavior; delivery still requires a currently live quorum.
- Check fallible version increments before mutating the in-memory store.
- Read SQLite aggregate JSON, immutable proposal and requirement copies, indexed
  fields, and original vote rows in one transaction. Require agreement and valid
  vote receipt chronology before reads, creation retries or state changes.
- Serialize SQLite write transactions before reading their compare-and-swap
  inputs. Configure busy timeout and foreign-key enforcement on each borrowed
  connection. Concurrent identical creation retries remain idempotent; concurrent
  delivery transitions have one winner.
- Extract SQLite collector persistence and snapshot reconciliation into private
  modules. `approval_store.rs` is 1,537 lines, down from 1,848. Public Rust paths
  and wire formats are unchanged; no schema migration or larger file cap is used.

Regression evidence:

- Kernel recovery integration tests: 16 passed, zero ignored. The initial 11
  negative regressions failed before the fix, with the valid-delivery control
  passing. Additional tests cover signed-but-rebound votes, creation constraints,
  inconsistent quorum metadata, and historical expiry.
- SQLite recovery integration tests: 8 passed, zero ignored. Three initial
  negative tests failed before the fix. They exercise reopening the real store,
  index and vote-row corruption, unchanged state after rejection, and creation
  retry validation. Eight-thread creation and delivery races, transactional
  rollback on integer overflow, and canonical default-algorithm retries also pass.

Local compatibility checks, with `umask 022`:

| Command / boundary | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel -p chio-store-sqlite --test threshold_collector_recovery` | 24 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel --lib approval` | 44 passed, zero ignored, including the 4-test threshold subset |
| `cargo test -p chio-store-sqlite --lib approval_store` | 10 passed, zero ignored, including v1 migration and restart |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel --test threshold_approval_records` | 8 passed, zero ignored; the separate validated-record API remains intact |
| `cargo test -p chio-store-sqlite --test approval_store --test governed_approval_kernel_replay` | 8 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-http-core --test approvals_endpoints` | 11 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo clippy -p chio-kernel -p chio-store-sqlite -p chio-http-core --lib --bins -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `cargo clippy -p chio-kernel -p chio-store-sqlite --test threshold_collector_recovery -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `cargo xtask check adapter-no-bypass` | Structured mediation contracts passed |
| `cargo xtask gen proof-coverage --check` after regeneration | 58 rows and 166 artifacts match; only inventory digests changed |
| Formatting, diff whitespace and Rust public-surface policy | Passed |
| Rust file-hygiene self-tests | Passed; full inventory still reports the 24 inherited violations |

This is snapshot integrity and current collector-authority validation, not
protection against an attacker replacing the entire database with a consistent
older snapshot. The collector still needs a trusted source of current request,
route, capability and policy context, a canonical validated-record persistence
path, and explicit lost-response/retry recovery before Task 9 can be closed.
The 24 inherited file-hygiene violations remain; this slice adds none. Full
workspace, exact-head hosted, native cage and observed-pilot qualification remain
separate requirements. Automatic response stays unpromoted.

## Canonical collector context and recovery, 2026-09-05

This slice reconciles the two collection APIs identified above. The existing
`ThresholdApprovalCollector` and `ThresholdApprovalCollectorStore` become the
canonical facade and persistence port. The unused default collection methods on
`ApprovalStore` are removed; its legacy human-approval and operation-owned replay
contracts remain. Existing validated registration/context types are reused, and
pure record projections remain available without owning a second storage path.

Completed source changes:

- Require `ThresholdApprovalContextResolver` at collector construction. Every
  facade operation resolves current authenticated request context and validates
  its exact route, requirement, subject, intent, capability digest, deadline,
  submitter and separation rule. A context constructor also rejects malformed
  deserialized routes and requirements.
- Accept only a signed proposal in the create HTTP body. Reject former
  caller-controlled authority fields even when their values are well-formed.
  Pass trusted current time through reads as well as mutations. API-protect
  rejects negative Unix timestamps before unsigned conversion.
- Require explicit trusted-source configuration for API-protect collection.
  The default sidecar does not enable collector endpoints from HTTP data.
- Advance approval-store schema metadata to revision 3. Retain unbound old
  collector records and reject their normal use until explicit
  `bind_existing_proposal` migration authenticates the original request.
  Atomic route binding preserves original votes, state and transition time.
  Retries do not increment its version again; overflow leaves storage unchanged.
- Make acknowledged creation and exact-vote retries return the actual retained
  state without resetting votes or receipt times. Reconstruct delivery retries
  from the immutable terminal timestamp, returning the exact original signed set
  only while all its members remain live. An expired surplus member cannot
  silently produce a smaller, differently hashed replay set.
- Enforce the execution replay identifier contract on restored votes, including
  the 512-byte ceiling and rejection of embedded NUL bytes.
- Preserve algorithm-aware submitter identities independently of replay token
  identifiers. A hybrid-key registration regression reproduced the incorrect
  application of the 512-byte token-ID limit to public-key encodings. Submitter
  encodings retain the collector artifact-size bound and exact comparison with
  authenticated typed context; replay token IDs keep their original limit.

The API and migration contract is documented in
[threshold approval collection](threshold-approval-collection.md). These are
intentional Rust and HTTP API changes, not a claim of wire compatibility with the
previous collector create request.

Targeted behavioral verification passed with `umask 022`: 135 tests, zero ignored.
The initial conformance build was interrupted to avoid exhausting the shared
build volume, then successfully rerun using an isolated temporary target cache.
The cache switch copied reusable artifacts without deleting the source cache or
modifying other worktrees.

| Command / boundary | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel --test threshold_approval_records` | 10 passed, including the reproduced hybrid-submitter regression |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel -p chio-store-sqlite --test threshold_collector_recovery` | 36 passed: 25 kernel and 11 SQLite restart, corruption, retry and migration tests |
| `cargo test -p chio-conformance --test protocol_primitives_authority_bindings` | 3 passed, including mutation vectors and exact quorum |
| `cargo test -p chio-api-protect --lib approval` | 12 passed, including control access, clock rejection and absent-runtime denial |
| `cargo test -p chio-kernel --lib approval` | 44 passed, including cumulative and active-response admission/replay |
| `cargo test -p chio-store-sqlite --lib approval_store` | 10 passed, including migration and retained replay tombstones |
| `cargo test -p chio-http-core --test approvals_endpoints` | 12 passed, including rejection of well-formed caller-controlled authority fields |
| `cargo test -p chio-store-sqlite --test approval_store --test governed_approval_kernel_replay` | 8 passed, including execution replay denial after reopen |

Final local source checks also passed:

- Clippy with warnings denied for kernel, SQLite, HTTP-core and API-protect
  libraries/binaries, plus the kernel/SQLite recovery, validated-record, HTTP
  endpoint and conformance integration targets.
- Structured mediation contracts (`cargo xtask check adapter-no-bypass`).
- Formatting, diff whitespace, Rust public-surface policy and hygiene self-tests.
- Regenerated proof inventory and its check: 58 rows and 166 artifacts match.
  This establishes inventory consistency, not a formal proof campaign.

The full file-hygiene inventory continues to report the same 24 inherited
violations. No file caps were increased or renewed.

Remaining Task 9/runtime work is explicit: the mandatory resolver port is not a
production authenticated request source. The reference runtime still needs to
compose retained admission/request state, current capability and policy checks,
submitter authentication, collection and kernel execution replay into a tested
durable lifecycle. The default sidecar's mediated endpoint continues to reject
threshold input without its threshold policy resolver. Callback fixtures and
disabled endpoints do not close that requirement.

The next integration must establish these boundaries together:

- Capture request context only after authenticated kernel admission, retaining
  enough original authority material to recheck capability ancestry, revocation,
  policy and exact request bindings after restart. A collector snapshot or an
  unfenced raw operation read is not that source.
- Resolve request-ID ambiguity across subjects and operations fail-closed.
  Source separation rules from trusted policy/configuration and the submitter
  from authenticated request identity, not from a convenient proposal field.
- Test denied admission without context publication, restart with missing
  context, revocation and policy change after voting, then an admitted execution
  and lost-response retry against the same durable replay reservation. Collection
  must not become a second execution authorization path.

The shared-parser audit identified recursive parsing of the classical half of
hybrid key and signature strings before nested-hybrid rejection. That defect is
closed in the bounded-decoding section below. Collector artifact limits alone
did not qualify this lower-level input boundary.

Full workspace, exact-head hosted, real native confinement and observed-pilot
qualification remain open. No launch or promotion is authorized by these local
changes; automatic response stays unpromoted.

## Bounded cryptographic wire decoding

The shared parser now rejects nested hybrids through a finite, non-recursive
grammar. It checks envelope and component lengths before hex decoding. Fixed
seed, hash, key and signature components decode into arrays; ECDSA signature
vectors are bounded to the largest valid DER encoding. One private borrowed
string visitor serves key, signature and hash deserialization without requiring
an owned input copy. Valid canonical wire output is unchanged.

The initial regression run had seven failures and one passing positive control.
Four child-process controls reproduced stack-overflow termination through direct
key/signature parsing and JSON deserialization. Other controls reproduced nested
parsing before structural rejection, oversized ECDSA acceptance and decoding
before size checks. Two additional hash controls failed before the adjacent
hash-decoder and string-visitor fixes. The subprocess regressions now require
exactly one executed test as well as successful termination.

The `no_std` plus `pq` cross-build also exposed missing `alloc::format` and
`alloc::string::ToString` imports in the existing PQ module. Explicit imports
restore that portable feature combination without enabling `std`.

Local source verification uses Rust and Cargo 1.94.1 on aarch64 Linux, the
dedicated target directory, the workspace lockfile with offline resolution,
`umask 022` and disabled core dumps:

| Command / boundary | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test -p chio-core-types` | 560 passed, zero ignored |
| `cargo test -p chio-core-types --all-features` | 611 passed, zero ignored; includes real P-256, P-384 and all three hybrid families |
| Exact `Cryptographic wire bounds and real signatures` workflow step | 16 listed and executed tests match, zero ignored or filtered |
| `cargo test -p chio-core-types --no-default-features --features pq --test crypto_wire_bounds --test hybrid_bitflip` | 19 passed, zero ignored; includes real Ed25519 plus ML-DSA-65 verification |
| `cargo build -p chio-core-types --no-default-features --lib` | Native build passed |
| Same portable library build with `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown` | Passed without PQ and with `--features pq` |
| Kernel, SQLite and API-protect library tests filtered by `approval` | 90 passed: 44 kernel, 34 SQLite and 12 API-protect, zero ignored |
| Kernel/SQLite `threshold_approval_records`, `threshold_collector_recovery`, `approval_store`, `governed_approval_kernel_replay`, plus HTTP `approvals_endpoints` | 66 passed, zero ignored or filtered |
| `cargo clippy -p chio-core-types --all-features --lib --tests -- -D warnings` | Passed with no warning allowances added |

The default and all-feature counts overlap; they are separate feature profiles,
not an aggregate count of distinct tests. Cross-target builds do not establish
browser execution or native confinement. The existing FIPS smoke workflow now
runs the exact parser inventory and both portable build variants. Its name and
the crate's `fips` feature do not establish module validation or certification.

See [cryptographic wire decoding](crypto-wire-decoding.md) for the encoded-size
contract, retained raw-constructor semantics, and the boundary between parsing
and cryptographic verification. Enclosing transports still need body and read
limits; deserializer scratch buffers are outside this parser's allocation bound.

Source gates passed for formatting, diff whitespace, structured mediation
contracts, workflow lint, the security CI contract and its trust-boundary
mutation self-tests, the exact test inventory verifier's self-tests, and the
Rust public-surface policy and hygiene self-tests. Regenerated proof coverage
matches 58 rows and 166 artifacts,
including the new private parser modules. This is inventory consistency, not a
new formal proof campaign.

The same 24 inherited file-hygiene violations remain. No caps were raised or
renewed. Production threshold request-context composition, complete workspace and
exact-head hosted gates, real confinement and observed-pilot qualification remain
open. These changes do not authorize preview publication or response promotion.

## Engineering acceptance

Use existing ports, validated types, opaque verified authority, checked arithmetic,
explicit state transitions, and RAII for resource custody. Keep unsafe operations
inside reviewed OS boundary modules with safety invariants. Production domain and
orchestration code must not add unsafe, unwrap, or expect. Security errors deny;
enforced configurations never fall back to legacy paths.

Run focused behavioral tests per change and the original complete security,
schema, formal, dependency, workspace, and release gates before promotion. Every
required filtered gate asserts nonzero execution. Negative controls must fail for
the intended reason; unavailable infrastructure is not evidence of enforcement.

Completion requires qualified packages and runtime, observed pilot and selected
containment promotion, and claim-to-evidence mapping for every advertised
guarantee. Implementation completion, preview publication, hosted qualification,
and operational promotion remain distinct records.
