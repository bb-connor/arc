# ARC Strategic Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Status:** milestone ladder through `v2.8` executed; launch hold pending hosted workflow observation
**Primary framing source:** `docs/research/DEEP_RESEARCH_1.md`

---

## Strategic Thesis

ARC should be understood as a **trust-and-economics control plane** for
agentic systems.

The moat is not basic connectivity. MCP, A2A, and payment protocols already
cover connectivity well enough. ARC's job is the harder layer under them:

- delegated authority
- bounded spend
- verifiable receipts
- enforceable governance
- accountable cross-system and cross-org execution

That is the economic-security thesis from the deep research work:

> **Economic security = delegated authority + bounded spend + verifiable
> receipts + enforceable governance across heterogeneous agent protocols.**

ARC should therefore be positioned as the **rights and receipts layer** under
MCP, A2A, payment rails, and future enterprise identity or attestation
systems, not as a transport competitor trying to replace them.

## What Is Already Shipped

ARC is not starting from zero. The shipped base now includes:

- fail-closed kernel mediation, guard evaluation, and signed receipts
- Merkle checkpoints, DPoP, truthful budget and settlement semantics, and
  receipt query/export/reporting
- portable-trust primitives including `did:arc`, passports, verifier-policy
  artifacts, challenge/response flows, and multi-issuer composition
- certification registry publication, resolution, supersession, and revocation
- A2A and MCP adapter surfaces plus enterprise identity and federation
  administration
- governed approvals, x402/ACP payment controls, settlement reconciliation, and
  explicit invocation-plus-money budget reporting
- insurer-facing behavioral feeds and attested runtime assurance tiers
- an explicit executable-formal launch evidence boundary for scope attenuation
- production qualification, release tooling, standards drafts, and the first
  architecture decomposition wave

The active rename milestone exists because the implementation and the product
story had drifted apart. ARC needs one coherent identity before the next major
feature wave lands.

## Strategic Principles

1. **Trust claims must be runtime-backed.**
   No launch, standards, or partner claim should outrun what the code and
   qualification evidence actually prove.

2. **Governance and economics stay fused.**
   Authorization without spend control is incomplete. Payment without proof is
   unsafe. ARC wins by keeping them in one contract.

3. **Adapters beat replacement.**
   ARC should sit under MCP, A2A, and payment ecosystems rather than trying to
   replace them outright.

4. **Compatibility work is first-class work.**
   Renames, migrations, and portable-trust transitions are product work, not
   cleanup afterthoughts.

5. **Launch claims wait for evidence.**
   Conditional release-candidate posture is acceptable. Unbacked GA claims are
   not.

## Milestone Ladder

### v2.5 ARC Rename and Identity Realignment

**Goal:** make ARC the real product identity across code, packages, CLI, docs,
spec, and operator materials without breaking verifiability or operator
continuity.

**Why it matters:** the economic-security story is stronger than the old ARC
framing, but only if the rename is handled as a migration contract instead of a
search-and-replace exercise.

**Core outcomes:**

- ARC-first package, CLI, SDK, and release identity
- ARC-primary schema issuance where implemented
- explicit compatibility rules for legacy `arc.*` artifacts and `did:arc`
- one coherent migration and qualification story

### v2.6 Governed Transactions and Payment Rails

**Goal:** make ARC's economic-security thesis concrete in operator workflows.

**Must land:**

- governed transaction intent and approval artifacts
- x402 bridge with truthful policy and receipt semantics
- ACP / Shared Payment Token bridge with scoped spend semantics
- explicit pending, settled, failed, and reconciled settlement states
- operator-visible reconciliation and accounting flows

**Why it matters:** this is the shortest path from "bounded spend exists in the
kernel" to "ARC governs real machine-mediated economic actions."

### v2.7 Portable Trust, Certification, and Federation Maturity

**Goal:** finish the portable-trust and discovery story so trust can move
between organizations conservatively and visibly.

**Must land:**

- enterprise identity propagation into portable credentials and federation
  artifacts
- passport lifecycle semantics: status, revocation, supersession, and
  distribution
- certification discovery and multi-operator/public registry semantics
- conservative cross-org reputation and trust distribution backed by evidence

**Why it matters:** ARC becomes materially more valuable when trust no longer
stops at one operator boundary.

### v2.8 Risk, Attestation, and Launch Closure

**Goal:** turn ARC's evidence substrate into external trust and close the gap
between production candidate and actual launch.

**Must land:**

- insurer-facing behavioral exports and risk-oriented reporting
- attested-runtime assurance tiers that can tighten or loosen granted rights
- proof/spec cleanup or explicit scoped deferral of any remaining formal debt
- real GA decision artifacts, not just conditional release-candidate posture

**Why it matters:** this is where ARC stops being merely auditable and becomes
financable, insurable, and standards-ready.

## Ecosystem Posture

ARC should pursue a partner map that matches the control-plane thesis:

- **MCP and A2A ecosystems:** integrate beneath them and become the trust
  substrate they intentionally do not provide
- **payments and commerce:** treat x402 and ACP/SPT systems as rails that ARC
  governs, not competitors to replace
- **enterprise IAM:** integrate with OIDC/OAuth-based identity providers so
  rights are legible to security reviewers and operators
- **attestation stacks:** treat TEEs and runtime evidence as a higher-assurance
  tier once the core economic and portable-trust surface is stable
- **standards bodies and regulators:** keep ARC's claims aligned to shipping
  evidence so the project remains legible in NIST, OAuth, OpenID, and W3C
  conversations

## Success Conditions

ARC is on the right path if the following become true in order:

1. the product identity is coherent and migration-safe
2. governed transactions and payment rails are real and truthful
3. portable trust and certification are usable across organizations
4. risk, attestation, and launch claims are supported by evidence

That sequence matters. The endgame is not a prettier protocol name. The
endgame is a market where consequential agent actions can be approved,
bounded, audited, financed, and insured because the underlying rights and
receipts are explicit and verifiable.

## Current Decision Checkpoint

The `v2.5` through `v2.8` ladder derived from
`docs/research/DEEP_RESEARCH_1.md` is now executed locally. The current
decision is:

- local evidence says ARC is ready for launch packaging on the shipped surface
- external release publication remains on hold until hosted `CI` and `Release
  Qualification` runs are observed on the candidate commit
- the next roadmap turn should start from post-launch or next-milestone work,
  not from reopening the rename, payment, trust, or formal-closure ladder
