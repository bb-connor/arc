# Chio DPoP Integration Guide

DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession) is Chio's optional sender-constrained invocation profile. When a `ToolGrant` carries `dpop_required: Some(true)`, the kernel requires the agent to attach a fresh cryptographic proof with every invocation. The proof binds the call to the agent's keypair, the specific capability token, the target tool, and the exact arguments. Grants without `dpop_required: Some(true)` remain compatibility paths and should not be described as universally sender-constrained.

## When DPoP Is Required

The `dpop_required` field on `ToolGrant` controls enforcement:

```rust
pub struct ToolGrant {
    // ...
    pub dpop_required: Option<bool>,
}
```

`Some(true)` requires a valid DPoP proof. `None` and `Some(false)` both disable DPoP for that grant. When the kernel encounters a request against a DPoP-required grant and no proof is supplied (or the proof fails verification), the invocation is denied.

## Proof Format

A DPoP proof is an Chio-native structure using Ed25519 and RFC 8785 canonical
JSON. It is not a JWT.

### DpopProofBody

```rust
pub struct DpopProofBody {
    pub schema: String,        // "chio.dpop_proof.v1" (compatibility schema alias accepted)
    pub capability_id: String, // token ID of the capability being used
    pub tool_server: String,   // server_id of the target tool server
    pub tool_name: String,     // name of the tool being called
    pub action_hash: String,   // SHA-256 hex of canonical JSON of tool arguments
    pub nonce: String,         // caller-chosen random string
    pub issued_at: u64,        // Unix seconds when the proof was created
    pub agent_key: PublicKey,  // hex-encoded Ed25519 public key of the signer
}
```

### DpopProof

```rust
pub struct DpopProof {
    pub body: DpopProofBody,
    pub signature: Signature,  // Ed25519 over canonical_json_bytes(&body)
}
```

The `signature` covers the canonical JSON (RFC 8785) of `body`. The field order in canonical JSON is alphabetical, which matches Rust's default serde serialization.

## Field Binding

Each proof is bound to a single invocation by four fields:

- `capability_id` must match the token ID in the request.
- `tool_server` must match the `server_id` of the target tool server.
- `tool_name` must match the tool being called.
- `action_hash` must equal the SHA-256 hex of the canonical JSON of the tool arguments. This prevents an adversary from reusing a proof with different arguments.

## Verification Steps

`verify_dpop_proof` in `chio-kernel` enforces six steps in order. The first failure returns an error and the invocation is denied.

1. Schema check: `body.schema` must equal the current Chio DPoP schema or a
   compatibility alias accepted by the verifier.
2. Sender constraint: `body.agent_key` must equal `capability.subject` (the public key the token was issued to).
3. Binding fields: `capability_id`, `tool_server`, `tool_name`, and `action_hash` must all match the kernel's expected values.
4. Freshness: `body.issued_at + proof_ttl_secs >= now` (proof not expired) and `body.issued_at <= now + max_clock_skew_secs` (proof not future-dated beyond tolerance).
5. Signature: Ed25519 verification of `signature` over canonical JSON of `body` using `agent_key`.
6. Nonce replay: the `(nonce, capability_id)` pair must not have been seen within the TTL window.

## DpopConfig

```rust
pub struct DpopConfig {
    pub proof_ttl_secs: u64,          // default: 300
    pub max_clock_skew_secs: u64,     // default: 30
    pub nonce_store_capacity: usize,  // default: 8192
}
```

`proof_ttl_secs` is how long a proof remains valid after `issued_at`. The default is 5 minutes. `max_clock_skew_secs` is how far in the future a proof's `issued_at` may be while still passing (to accommodate slight clock differences between client and server). The default is 30 seconds.

`nonce_store_capacity` limits the in-memory LRU nonce replay cache. Nonces are keyed by `(nonce, capability_id)`. When the cache is full, the LRU entry is evicted. Capacity should be set above the expected peak rate of concurrent calls times the TTL window.

## Generating Proofs (Rust)

```rust
use chio_kernel::dpop::{DpopProof, DpopProofBody, DPOP_SCHEMA};

let body = DpopProofBody {
    schema: DPOP_SCHEMA.to_string(),
    capability_id: token.id.clone(),
    tool_server: "filesystem".to_string(),
    tool_name: "read_file".to_string(),
    action_hash: sha256_hex_of_canonical_args(&args),
    nonce: random_hex_16(),
    issued_at: unix_now_secs(),
    agent_key: agent_keypair.public_key(),
};

let proof = DpopProof::sign(body, &agent_keypair)?;
```

Attach `proof` to the `ToolCallRequest.dpop_proof` field before sending.

## Generating Proofs (TypeScript SDK)

See `docs/SDK_TYPESCRIPT_REFERENCE.md` for the `signDpopProof` function. The
TypeScript implementation now emits the Chio-primary schema identifier while
remaining interoperable with verifiers that still accept legacy `arc.*`
proofs.
