# Chio Economic Layer: Developer Guide

**Audience:** Developers integrating Chio's metering, budgets, credit,
settlement, anchoring, reputation, or passport subsystems.

**Scope:** How to wire up the economic primitives, what each one produces,
and which CLI commands move the workflow forward. This guide is the
pragmatic companion to `docs/protocols/ECONOMIC-LAYER-OVERVIEW.md`, which
describes the model-level design.

---

## 1. Overview

Chio's economic layer turns the kernel's signed audit trail into a full
accounting system. The same receipt that proves a tool call happened also
carries the cost attribution, budget context, and settlement reference that
billing, risk, and insurance subsystems need. Nothing in the layer is
self-reported: every artifact downstream of a receipt is either derived
deterministically from signed evidence or signed itself.

The layer exists to answer five developer-facing questions:

1. **What did this agent spend?** `chio-metering` + receipt cost metadata.
2. **Can I prove it happened?** `chio-anchor` + checkpoints + chain proofs.
3. **Did the money move?** `chio-settle` over EVM, Solana, or CCIP.
4. **Can I trust this agent across organizations?** `chio-reputation` +
   `chio-credentials` passports.
5. **What is this agent's current trust tier?** An evaluated passport against
   a verifier policy.

Each question maps to a small set of signed artifacts and a small set of CLI
subcommands under the unified `arc` binary (with `chio-mercury` for
partner-facing evidence bundles). You do not need to understand the full
stack to use any one piece: metering works without settlement, reputation
works without passports, passports work without on-chain anchoring.

## 2. Primitives

| Primitive | Crate | Artifact |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Capability token | `chio-core` | `CapabilityToken` with `ToolGrant.max_total_cost` |
| Receipt | `chio-core` | `ChioReceipt` with `FinancialReceiptMetadata` and `CostMetadata` |
| Checkpoint | `chio-kernel` | `KernelCheckpoint` (Merkle-committed batch) |
| Anchor | `chio-anchor` | `Web3ChainAnchorRecord`, `AnchorProofBundle` |
| Settlement call | `chio-settle` | `PreparedEvmCall`, `PreparedSolanaSettlement` |
| Reputation score | `chio-reputation` | `LocalReputationScorecard` |
| Reputation credential | `chio-credentials` | Signed Verifiable Credential |
| Agent passport | `chio-credentials` | `AgentPassport` bundle |
| Exposure / credit / bond | `chio-credit` | Signed credit artifacts |
| Underwriting decision | `chio-underwriting` | `UnderwritingDecisionArtifact` |
| Liability coverage | `chio-market` | `LiabilityBoundCoverageArtifact` |

All artifacts use canonical JSON (RFC 8785) for signing. Every economic
decision traces back to one or more receipts you can verify independently.

---

## 3. Receipt as Evidence

The receipt is the foundation. Everything else in the economic layer is a
projection, derivation, or anchor of receipts.

### 3.1 Shape

Every allowed tool call produces an `ChioReceipt` signed by the kernel. When
the call is cost-bearing, the receipt carries `FinancialReceiptMetadata`
(see `crates/chio-core/src/receipt.rs`) plus a `CostMetadata` block from
`chio-metering` (`crates/chio-metering/src/lib.rs`). The financial fields
include:

- `cost_charged` / `cost_currency` -- the amount the kernel committed
- `budget_remaining` -- post-call residual on the capability token
- `settlement_status` -- `not_applicable` / `pending` / `settled` / `failed`
- `payment_reference` -- external payment rail handle (when present)
- `delegation_depth` and `root_budget_holder` -- cost-responsibility chain

### 3.2 Lineage

Receipts carry delegation depth and parent-capability references. To
reconstruct the responsibility chain for any receipt:

1. Read `root_budget_holder` from the receipt's financial metadata.
2. Walk the capability-lineage records (available via
   `chio-store-sqlite::SqliteReceiptStore` or evidence-export) by
   `parent_capability_id` until depth zero.
3. The resulting chain is the authoritative attribution path.

### 3.3 Compliance value

Because each receipt is individually signed and canonically serialized, a
receipt database is by construction an append-only ledger. A compliance
reviewer can:

- Replay every signature offline with the issuer's public key.
- Sum `cost_charged` by `(capability, tool_server, period)` to produce an
  invoice without trusting any backend service.
- Export a verifiable package (see `arc evidence export`) that a partner can
  independently re-verify.

Query receipts:

```
arc receipt list --capability <cap-id> --tool-server <server-id> \
  --since <unix-ts> --until <unix-ts> --min-cost <minor-units>
```

See `crates/chio-cli/src/cli/types.rs:1883` for the full filter list.

---

## 4. Anchoring

Anchoring takes the kernel's rolling Merkle tree over receipts and commits
it to external substrates so that tampering with the local log becomes
detectable even if the kernel operator is compromised.

### 4.1 What gets anchored

The kernel produces a `KernelCheckpoint` (`crates/chio-kernel/src/checkpoint.rs`)
at operator-configured intervals. Each checkpoint commits to a batch of
receipts by Merkle root plus a range `[batch_start_seq, batch_end_seq]`.
The checkpoint body is canonical JSON and signed by the kernel.

`chio-anchor` publishes that Merkle root to one or more chains. A published
root becomes a `Web3ChainAnchorRecord`. Multiple records over the same
checkpoint accumulate into an `AnchorProofBundle` that proves the receipt
was committed to every lane that matters to the relying party.

### 4.2 Substrates

| Lane | Module | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| EVM root registry | `crates/chio-anchor/src/evm.rs` | Direct publish of the Merkle root to an ChioRootRegistry contract (`prepare_root_publication`, `confirm_root_publication`). |
| Bitcoin via OTS | `crates/chio-anchor/src/bitcoin.rs` | Super-root aggregation timestamped via OpenTimestamps (`prepare_ots_submission`, `verify_ots_proof_for_submission`). |
| Solana memo | `crates/chio-anchor/src/solana.rs` | Canonical memo publication (`prepare_solana_memo_publication`, `verify_solana_anchor`). |
| Chainlink Functions | `crates/chio-anchor/src/functions.rs` | Off-chain attestation verification path with fallback assessment. |

The `AnchorServiceConfig` struct (`crates/chio-anchor/src/lib.rs:98`)
composes the target set; the runtime can enforce lane-availability policies
through `ops::ensure_anchor_operation_allowed`.

### 4.3 Verification

Given a receipt, a checkpoint, and an `AnchorProofBundle`:

```rust
use chio_anchor::{verify_proof_bundle, AnchorProofBundle};

let report = verify_proof_bundle(&bundle, &checkpoint)?;
// report.lane_outcomes: one entry per lane (EVM / Bitcoin / Solana)
// report.overall: fail-closed aggregate
```

`verify_proof_bundle` is fail-closed: a single invalid lane rejects the
bundle. Use `verify_proof_bundle_with_discovery` when you want to evaluate
freshness against a published discovery artifact
(`crates/chio-anchor/src/discovery.rs`).

### 4.4 Recipe: anchor a batch

1. Let checkpoints accumulate in the kernel receipt store.
2. For each checkpoint you want to anchor, call
   `prepare_root_publication` for each configured EVM target; submit the
   call with your operator key; then `confirm_root_publication` once
   finality is reached.
3. For Bitcoin coverage, call `prepare_ots_submission` over the set of EVM
   anchor records; submit via your OTS client; record the resulting
   attestation.
4. Persist the anchor records and build an `AnchorProofBundle` per
   checkpoint that covers every required lane.
5. Publish the bundle alongside the checkpoint for verifiers.

The `automation` module provides typed `AnchorAutomationJob` records that
drive scheduled publication without custom orchestration code.

---

## 5. Settlement

`chio-settle` turns approved capital instructions into real contract calls
and projects the on-chain state back into the receipt family. The module
layout lives in `crates/chio-settle/src/lib.rs`.

### 5.1 When to settle on-chain

Not every receipt needs on-chain settlement. Use it when:

- Parties do not share a trusted custodian (escrow removes the need).
- Collateral is at stake (bond lock / release / impair).
- Amounts exceed the `SettlementAmountTier` threshold configured in
  `SettlementPolicyConfig`.
- A regulator or auditor requires tamper-evident settlement proof.

For small, high-frequency flows between trusted parties, off-chain
settlement via the kernel's `PaymentAdapter` (x402, ACP, direct API) is
more appropriate. `chio-settle` provides adapters for those too, but the
actual transfer happens off-chain.

### 5.2 EVM path

Primary entry points (`crates/chio-settle/src/evm.rs`):

- `prepare_web3_escrow_dispatch` + `finalize_escrow_dispatch`
- `prepare_bond_lock` / `prepare_bond_release` / `prepare_bond_impair` /
  `prepare_bond_expiry`
- `prepare_dual_sign_release` -- operator + counterparty sign-off
- `prepare_merkle_release` -- batch settlement via Merkle proof
- `prepare_erc20_approval` + `scale_arc_amount_to_token_minor_units`
- `static_validate_call` (runs before every submission)
- `submit_call` + `confirm_transaction`

Each `prepare_*` function returns a `PreparedEvmCall` with gas estimation
and static validation completed. The workflow is always: prepare, validate,
submit, confirm, project.

### 5.3 Solana path

Ed25519-native surface (`crates/chio-settle/src/solana.rs`):

- `prepare_solana_settlement` -- builds a settlement transaction using the
  Ed25519 program for signature verification.
- `verify_solana_binding_and_receipt` -- checks that a given Solana
  settlement matches the Chio receipt it claims to settle.
- `compare_commitments` -- produces a `CommitmentConsistencyReport`
  comparing Chio-side and Solana-side commitment state.

### 5.4 Cross-chain and HTTP rails

- CCIP cross-chain messaging: `crates/chio-settle/src/ccip.rs`
  (`prepare_ccip_settlement_message`, `reconcile_ccip_delivery`).
- x402 HTTP 402 requirements: `build_x402_payment_requirements` in
  `crates/chio-settle/src/payments.rs`.
- EIP-3009 meta-transactions: `prepare_transfer_with_authorization`.
- Circle nanopayments: `evaluate_circle_nanopayment`.
- ERC-4337 paymaster compatibility: `prepare_paymaster_compatibility`.

### 5.5 Settlement receipts

After confirmation, project the on-chain result back into the receipt
family:

```rust
use chio_settle::{inspect_finality_for_receipt, project_escrow_execution_receipt};

let finality = inspect_finality_for_receipt(&tx, &receipt_binding)?;
let exec_receipt = project_escrow_execution_receipt(&projection_input)?;
```

The projected execution receipt is a signed artifact that:

- References the originating capability and tool-call receipt.
- Carries the on-chain transaction hash and block reference.
- Gets stored alongside the original receipt so downstream consumers see a
  complete `receipt -> settlement -> finality` chain.

The `automation` module (`build_settlement_watchdog_job`,
`build_bond_watchdog_job`) schedules recurring checks for expiry,
state drift, and recovery opportunities.

### 5.6 Recipe: query settlement status

1. Pull the receipt(s) you care about with `arc receipt list`.
2. Read `financial.settlement_status` and `financial.payment_reference`.
3. For `pending` settlements backed by on-chain rails, call
   `inspect_finality_for_receipt` with the transaction reference.
4. For recovery classification (replaceable, superseded, reverted),
   call `classify_settlement_lane` + `SettlementRecoveryAction`.
5. The `ops::SettlementRuntimeReport` (schema in
   `docs/standards/CHIO_SETTLE_RUNTIME_REPORT_EXAMPLE.json`) is the
   operator-facing aggregate of every lane's current state.

Emergency controls (`SettlementEmergencyControls`,
`SettlementEmergencyMode`) allow a kill switch or circuit breaker to block
new settlements while existing ones drain.

---

## 6. Reputation

Reputation converts a receipt corpus into a portable signal of how an agent
has behaved. `chio-reputation` is intentionally pure and storage-agnostic
(`crates/chio-reputation/src/lib.rs:1`): scoring never touches the network
and never mutates anything.

### 6.1 Local scoring

`compute_local_scorecard` (`crates/chio-reputation/src/score.rs:3`) takes a
`LocalReputationCorpus` -- receipts, capability-lineage records, and
budget-usage rows -- and produces a `LocalReputationScorecard` with eight
weighted dimensions:

- Boundary pressure (deny ratio)
- Resource stewardship (budget fit)
- Least privilege (scope narrowness)
- History depth (corpus maturity)
- Specialization (tool focus)
- Delegation hygiene (child-grant discipline)
- Reliability (success ratio)
- Incident correlation (external signal coupling)

The output includes per-dimension scores, an effective overall score, and
explicit evidence references so a reviewer can trace every number back to
specific receipts.

### 6.2 Local vs. federated

"Local" means scored against your own receipt store. Federated scoring
relies on the passport workflow (next section): the subject's home
authority signs a reputation credential over their local corpus, and a
remote verifier evaluates the signed credential instead of re-running
scoring against raw receipts. This keeps raw behavior private while still
producing a verifiable trust signal.

### 6.3 Recipe: compute a reputation score

```
arc reputation local \
  --subject-public-key <hex> \
  --since <unix-ts> --until <unix-ts> \
  --policy <optional-policy-yaml>
```

See `crates/chio-cli/src/cli/types.rs:2727`. To compare live state against a
portable passport:

```
arc reputation compare \
  --subject-public-key <hex> \
  --passport passport.json \
  --verifier-policy policy.json
```

The compare path returns per-dimension deltas plus a drift summary. Use it
to detect staleness or federation-boundary discrepancies.

---

## 7. Passport

The agent passport is how an agent proves standing to a party outside its
home authority. It is a bundle of signed Verifiable Credentials keyed to
the subject's DID (see `crates/chio-did/` for did:chio), synthesized from
local evidence (receipts, reputation, certifications, runtime assurance).

### 7.1 Bundle contents

An `AgentPassport` (`crates/chio-credentials/src/...`) typically contains:

- A reputation credential over the subject's local scorecard.
- Attestation windows describing the covered evidence period.
- Optional enterprise-identity provenance.
- Optional lifecycle reference (`PassportLifecycleState`) for revocation
  checking.
- Zero or more additional credentials (certifications, runtime assurance).

Passports are selectively disclosable: `arc passport present` filters the
bundle down to what the relying party asked for without invalidating
signatures on the remaining credentials.

### 7.2 Evaluation vs. verification

- **Verify** (`arc passport verify`) -- signature checks on every embedded
  credential. No relying-party policy required.
- **Evaluate** (`arc passport evaluate --policy <file>`) -- applies a
  `PassportVerifierPolicy` (allow-lists, minimum scores, maximum age,
  required issuers) and produces a pass/fail resolution.

### 7.3 Trust-tier synthesis

Evaluation returns a `PassportLifecycleResolution` plus a derived trust
tier. The tier combines:

- Reputation score band
- Runtime assurance tier (from runtime-attestation credential if present)
- Certification state (from certification credential if present)
- Lifecycle state (active / revoked / suspended)

Relying parties translate the tier into their own admission decision; Chio
itself does not force a policy.

### 7.4 Challenge-bound presentations

For replay-safe flows, use the challenge protocol:

1. Verifier creates a challenge with `arc passport challenge create`.
2. Holder responds with `arc passport challenge respond`
   (`--holder-seed-file` signs the response with the subject key).
3. Holder submits to the verifier transport via `arc passport challenge submit`.
4. Verifier confirms with `arc passport challenge verify`, resolving the
   challenge from a local SQLite database or a trust-control service.

OID4VCI issuance and OID4VP request flows are wired under
`arc passport issuance ...` and `arc passport oid4vp ...` respectively.

### 7.5 Recipe: issue and present a passport

```
# Create a passport from local receipts and lineage
arc passport create \
  --subject-public-key <hex> \
  --output passport.json \
  --signing-seed-file ./authority.seed \
  --validity-days 30 \
  --since <unix-ts> --until <unix-ts>

# Verify signatures on every embedded credential
arc passport verify --input passport.json

# Evaluate against a relying-party policy
arc passport evaluate --input passport.json --policy verifier-policy.yaml

# Present a filtered bundle to a specific verifier
arc passport present \
  --input passport.json \
  --output presented.json \
  --issuer did:chio:... \
  --max-credentials 2
```

See `crates/chio-cli/src/cli/types.rs:2222` for the full option surface.

## 8. Credit, Insurance, and Marketplace Integration

The artifacts in this section live above the primitives above. You do not
need them for basic metering or settlement, but they are what binds the
economic layer into a marketplace.

### 8.1 Exposure and scorecard

`arc trust exposure-ledger ...` produces a `ExposureLedgerReport` (per-
currency settlement position). `arc trust credit-scorecard ...` produces a
`CreditScorecardReport` over the exposure ledger plus reputation
inspection. Both are signed and can be fed to underwriting or insurance
workflows.

### 8.2 Underwriting

Pipeline is: `arc trust underwriting-input` builds a signed
`UnderwritingPolicyInput`; `arc trust underwriting-decision` runs the pure
`evaluate_underwriting_policy_input` and emits an
`UnderwritingDecisionArtifact` with risk class, budget recommendation, and
premium quote. Appeals go through `arc trust underwriting-appeal`.

### 8.3 Facilities and bonds

`arc trust facility ...` issues bounded credit facilities; `arc trust bond
...` manages reserve locks; `arc trust loss ...` captures delinquency,
recovery, reserve-release, reserve-slash, and write-off events with strict
accounting invariants (see section 1.3 of the economic overview).

### 8.4 Capital execution

`arc trust capital-instruction ...` produces custody-neutral instructions;
`arc trust capital-allocation ...` emits simulation-first allocation
decisions; `arc trust capital-book ...` exports the live capital book
tying facilities, bonds, and losses to one source-of-funds view.

### 8.5 Liability marketplace

`arc trust liability-provider ...` manages provider registry entries;
`arc trust liability-market ...` drives quote, placement, and bound-
coverage workflows. The provider-risk package exported via
`arc trust provider-risk-package ...` is the signed evidence bundle sent
to underwriters.

### 8.6 Mercury evidence bundles

`chio-mercury` is a separate binary for partner-facing evidence packaging.
Core commands (`crates/chio-mercury/src/main.rs:19`):

- `chio-mercury proof export` -- wrap a verified Chio evidence package.
- `chio-mercury inquiry export` -- build an inquiry package from a proof.
- `chio-mercury verify` -- verify a proof or inquiry package.
- Workflow-specific lanes: `pilot`, `supervised-live`, `downstream-review`,
  `governance-workbench`, `assurance-suite`, `embedded-oem`,
  `trust-network`, `release-readiness`, `controlled-adoption`,
  `reference-distribution`, `broader-distribution`,
  `selective-account-activation`, `delivery-continuity`,
  `renewal-qualification`, `second-account-expansion`,
  `portfolio-program`, `second-portfolio-program`, `third-program`,
  `program-family`, `portfolio-revenue-boundary`.

Each lane produces a `MercuryPackage` bound to the underlying Chio receipt
evidence so that partner reviews never lose the verifiable substrate.

## 9. Developer Recipes

### 9.1 Track every tool call cost

1. Configure the budget store (`--budget-db`) and receipt store
   (`--receipt-db`) when launching the kernel.
2. Issue capabilities with `ToolGrant.max_total_cost` set.
3. Ensure tool servers report cost per invocation (see
   `docs/TOOL_PRICING_GUIDE.md`).
4. Query cumulative cost:

```
arc receipt list --capability <cap-id> --min-cost 0
```

Pipe the JSON-Lines output into any analytics pipeline.

### 9.2 Export a billing record

Use `BillingExport` from `chio-metering` inside a Rust program, or drive it
via an evidence export:

```
arc evidence export \
  --output ./billing-2026-04 \
  --since <month-start> --until <month-end> \
  --capability <cap-id>
```

The exported directory is signature-checkable end-to-end with `arc evidence
verify --input ./billing-2026-04`.

### 9.3 Anchor a batch

See section 4.4 above. The short version:

```
# 1. Let the kernel produce a checkpoint covering the batch you care about.
# 2. Publish the Merkle root to EVM:
#    (programmatic; no dedicated CLI subcommand yet)
cargo run -p chio-anchor --example publish_root -- \
  --checkpoint checkpoint.json --target evm-target.json
# 3. Attach a Bitcoin OTS anchor:
cargo run -p chio-anchor --example attach_bitcoin_anchor -- \
  --records evm-records.json --ots-proof proof.ots
# 4. Verify the resulting bundle:
cargo run -p chio-anchor --example verify_bundle -- \
  --bundle bundle.json --checkpoint checkpoint.json
```

The public API is stable; the CLI surface is currently
programmatic-first. Direct access is via `chio_anchor::prepare_root_publication`
and friends in any Rust or SDK caller.

### 9.4 Query settlement status

See section 5.6.

### 9.5 Compute and share a reputation score

```
# Local score
arc reputation local --subject-public-key <hex>

# Signed reputation credential embedded in a passport
arc passport create \
  --subject-public-key <hex> \
  --output passport.json \
  --signing-seed-file authority.seed

# Share passport; verifier evaluates:
arc passport evaluate --input passport.json --policy policy.yaml
```

### 9.6 Issue federated delegation after a portable presentation

```
# Verifier side: issue one local capability after validating a presentation
arc trust federated-issue \
  --presentation-response response.json \
  --challenge challenge.json \
  --capability-policy policy.yaml \
  --delegation-policy signed-delegation-policy.json
```

See `crates/chio-cli/src/cli/types.rs:667` for the full option set.

### 10.4 Anchor and settle surfaces

Anchoring and settlement currently expose programmatic APIs rather than
first-class `arc` subcommands. The relevant entry points:

- `chio-anchor::prepare_root_publication` (EVM) -- `crates/chio-anchor/src/evm.rs`
- `chio-anchor::prepare_ots_submission` (Bitcoin) -- `crates/chio-anchor/src/bitcoin.rs`
- `chio-anchor::prepare_solana_memo_publication` -- `crates/chio-anchor/src/solana.rs`
- `chio-anchor::verify_proof_bundle` -- `crates/chio-anchor/src/bundle.rs`
- `chio-settle::prepare_web3_escrow_dispatch` and bond functions --
  `crates/chio-settle/src/evm.rs`
- `chio-settle::prepare_solana_settlement` -- `crates/chio-settle/src/solana.rs`
- `chio-settle::prepare_ccip_settlement_message` -- `crates/chio-settle/src/ccip.rs`
- `chio-settle::build_x402_payment_requirements` -- `crates/chio-settle/src/payments.rs`

The settlement runtime report schema is published at
`docs/standards/CHIO_SETTLE_RUNTIME_REPORT_EXAMPLE.json`; the settle profile
is at `docs/standards/CHIO_SETTLE_PROFILE.md`.
