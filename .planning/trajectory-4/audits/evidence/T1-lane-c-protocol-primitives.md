# T1 Lane C Protocol Primitives Evidence

## Scope

Lane C owns T1.0, T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, and T1.6.

## Implemented Surfaces

- T1.0: `chio.capabilities.v1`, schema-aware capability signing, and
  signed-artifact compatibility registry.
- T1.1: default-on delegation primitives, typed caveats, attenuation witness
  generation and verification, and capability v2 signing.
- T1.2: receipt v2 body-hash input, typed signing wrapper, replay set keyed
  only by `body_hash`, DAG parent-set hash, and ordinal checks.
- T1.3: `chio.anchor_batch.v1` Merkle batching, inclusion verification, and
  public-witness semantics documentation.
- T1.6: `chio receipt explain <receipt-id>` CLI narrator for v1 and v2 receipts.

## Evidence Gate Pointers

## Proof Report

`scripts/generate-proof-report.sh --no-run-gates` is the local non-gating
generation path when the formal toolchain is unavailable. The formal generated
report target remains `target/formal/proof-report.json`.
