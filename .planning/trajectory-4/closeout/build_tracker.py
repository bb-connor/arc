    header = """# Trj4 close-bar tracker

This file is the per-row ledger that the trj4 closeout grades against. Every
row corresponds to one brainstorm idea (per `BRAINSTORM-V1-FEATURE-CATALOG.md`),
one Evidence Gate ticket (per `SYNTHESIS-V2-INTEGRATED-PLAN.md` Tier-1 work),
or one of the 30 audit close-bar items (also from SYNTHESIS-V2). Bootstrap
state mirrors the audit findings on the trj4-planning baseline.

The tracker is consumed by `scripts/check-close-bar-tracker.sh`, which:

- asserts >= 153 rows;
- catches the audit's "types-only" pattern (`Bucket=DONE` + `Wired runtime path=n`);
- requires every `Bucket=DONE` row to point at a real negative-conformance test;
- requires every `Theorem status=proven` row to point at a present file;
- compares the tracker against a committed snapshot
  (`audits/evidence/close-bar-snapshot.json`) and refuses regressions
  (DONE -> PARTIAL or PARTIAL -> NONE);
- emits `audits/evidence/close-bar-current.json` for downstream tooling.

Wave numbering follows the trj4 closeout plan
(`/Users/connor/.claude/plans/typed-coalescing-hejlsberg.md`):
Wave 1 covers the three Tier-0 capability bugs; Waves 2..14 cover the plumbing
rollouts described in SYNTHESIS-V2 Tiers 0/1/2; Wave 15 is the DX sweep;
Wave 16 is the final close.

Theorem status is `n-a` for any row that does not stand on a Lean theorem.
For T1.x slices that DO depend on a theorem, the column is `proposed` until
the theorem is proven and a `formal/lean/...` file path is filed in `Notes`.
Per the post-Wave-0 E0.1 demotion, all 9 trj4 theorems start as `proposed`.
