## What is Chio?

Chio is a protocol for secure, attested tool access in AI agent systems. It replaces ad-hoc MCP-style wiring with a ground-up design built on capability-based security, cryptographic attestation, and privilege separation. The kernel mediates every tool call: capabilities are time-bounded and verifiable, guards evaluate input and output before anything crosses a trust boundary, and every decision is signed into an append-only receipt log. Policy and guards ship as first-class native components (`chio-policy`, `chio-guards`, `chio-data-guards`, `chio-external-guards`, `chio-wasm-guards`); no external policy engine is required.

## Five Components

1. **Agent** - untrusted LLM-powered process that consumes tools via capability tokens.
2. **Runtime Kernel** - trusted mediator (TCB) that validates capabilities, runs the guard pipeline, and signs receipts.
3. **Tool Servers** - sandboxed processes implementing tools, isolated from each other and from the agent.
4. **Capability Authority** - issues, scopes, and revokes time-bounded capability tokens.
5. **Receipt Log** - append-only Merkle-committed log of signed attestations over every decision and tool call.

## Crate Map

The workspace ships ~65 crates. The table below lists representative crates per group; see `Cargo.toml` for the full list.

| HTTP & Session | `chio-http-core`, `chio-http-session` | Shared HTTP primitives and session lifecycle. |
| Products | `chio-cli`, `chio-wall`, `chio-mercury`, `chio-api-protect` | End-user binaries and product surfaces built on the protocol. |

## Build and Test

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

## Conventions

- **Fail-closed**: errors during evaluation deny access. Invalid policies reject at load time.
- **Clippy**: `unwrap_used = "deny"`, `expect_used = "deny"` in all crates.
- **Serialization**: canonical JSON (RFC 8785) for all signed payloads.
- **Commit messages**: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, etc.).
- **No em dashes** in code, comments, or documentation. Use hyphens or parentheses.
