# Protocol Bridges and Edge Documentation

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Status:** Normative companion to PROTOCOL.md

This document specifies how the Chio kernel's trust contract extends to
external protocol surfaces through bridges and edges. Each section covers
one bridge or edge crate, its invocation flow, fidelity assessment, and
receipt integration.

All bridges and edges share the same security invariant: every mediated
action flows through the Chio kernel guard pipeline, producing a signed
receipt regardless of the upstream or downstream protocol.

---

## 1. OpenAPI-to-MCP Bridge (`chio-openapi-mcp-bridge`)

### 1.1 Overview

The OpenAPI-to-MCP bridge presents Chio-governed HTTP APIs as MCP tool
surfaces. Given an OpenAPI 3.x specification, the bridge:

1. Parses the spec via `chio-openapi` to produce `ToolDefinition` values.
2. Wraps each HTTP operation as an MCP-visible tool via `chio-mcp-edge`.
3. Routes invocations through the Chio kernel for capability validation
   and receipt signing before dispatching to the upstream HTTP API.

The bridge MUST generate a valid `chio.manifest.v1` manifest from the
OpenAPI spec. If the spec contains zero publishable operations, the
bridge MUST reject construction with a manifest error.

### 1.2 tools/list Generation

Each HTTP operation (method + path pair) in the OpenAPI spec becomes one
entry in the MCP `tools/list` response. The mapping rules are:

| OpenAPI Field | MCP Tool Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `operationId` | `name` | Falls back to `"{METHOD} {path}"` if absent |
| `summary` / `description` | `description` | Concatenated if both present |
| Request body schema or parameters | `inputSchema` | Merged into a single JSON Schema object |
| Response schema (200/201) | `outputSchema` | Optional; included when `include_output_schemas` is set |
| HTTP method | `annotations.readOnlyHint` | `true` for GET/HEAD/OPTIONS; `false` otherwise |

The bridge MUST set `has_side_effects` to `false` for GET, HEAD, and
OPTIONS operations and `true` for all other HTTP methods.

When `x-chio-*` extensions are present in the OpenAPI spec, they are
propagated to the corresponding `ToolDefinition` fields as specified in
[OPENAPI-INTEGRATION.md](OPENAPI-INTEGRATION.md).

### 1.3 Invocation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as MCP Client
    participant B as OpenAPI-MCP Bridge
    participant K as Chio Kernel
    participant U as Upstream HTTP API

    C->>B: tools/call(tool_name, arguments)
    B->>B: Resolve route binding (method, path)
    B->>K: Validate capability token
    K->>K: Run guard pipeline
    alt Guard denies
        K-->>B: Deny verdict
        B-->>C: Error response (isError: true)
    else Guard allows
        K-->>B: Allow verdict
        B->>U: HTTP request (method, url, body)
        U-->>B: HTTP response (status, body)
        B->>K: Sign receipt
        K-->>B: Signed Chio receipt
        B-->>C: tools/call result with structuredContent
    end
```

The bridge MUST resolve the route binding from the tool name before
dispatching. If the tool name does not match any known route binding, the
bridge MUST return a `ToolNotFound` error without contacting the upstream
API.

The `structuredContent` field in the MCP response MUST include:

- `httpStatus`: the HTTP status code from the upstream response
- `method`: the HTTP method used
- `path`: the URL path template
- `body`: the parsed response body

### 1.4 Receipt Generation

Every bridged invocation that reaches the upstream HTTP API MUST produce
a signed Chio receipt. The receipt MUST include:

- `tool_name`: the MCP tool name (derived from `operationId`)
- `server_id`: the bridge's configured server ID
- `decision`: `allow` for successful invocations; `deny` if the guard
  pipeline rejects the request

When no HTTP dispatcher is configured, the bridge operates in simulation
mode. Simulation mode responses MUST set `structuredContent.bridgeMode`
to `"simulation"` and SHOULD NOT produce receipts since no upstream call
occurs.

### 1.5 Kernel Integration

The bridge implements `ToolServerConnection`, allowing direct
registration with an Chio kernel instance. Both borrowed (`BridgeToolServer`)
and owned (`OwnedBridgeToolServer`) variants are provided:

- `BridgeToolServer<'a>`: borrows the bridge; suitable for scoped kernel
  registration.
- `OwnedBridgeToolServer`: consumes the bridge; suitable for long-lived
  kernel registration where the bridge outlives the construction scope.

Both variants delegate `invoke()` to the bridge's internal dispatch
logic, mapping `BridgeError` to `KernelError::ToolServerError`.

---

## 2. A2A Edge (`chio-a2a-edge`)

### 2.1 Overview

The A2A edge exposes Chio kernel-governed tools as A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
skills. This is the reverse direction from `chio-a2a-adapter`: instead of
consuming a remote A2A server, this crate serves Chio tools to external
A2A clients.

Every invocation flows through the kernel guard pipeline, producing a
signed Chio receipt.

### 2.2 Agent Card Generation

The edge MUST serve an Agent Card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`. The
Agent Card is generated from the edge configuration and registered tool
manifests.

The Agent Card structure:

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `A2aEdgeConfig.agent_name` | MUST be non-empty |
| `description` | `A2aEdgeConfig.agent_description` | Human-readable summary |
| `version` | `A2aEdgeConfig.agent_version` | Semantic version |
| `supportedInterfaces` | Derived from config | One entry per endpoint URL |
| `capabilities.streaming` | Fixed `false` on the authoritative A2A profile | Chio does not currently advertise a receipt-bearing streaming/task lifecycle |
| `defaultInputModes` | `["text"]` | Fixed for current implementation |
| `defaultOutputModes` | `["text"]` | Fixed for current implementation |
| `skills` | Derived from tool manifests | One skill per Chio tool |

Each interface entry MUST include:

- `url`: the A2A endpoint URL
- `protocolBinding`: the protocol binding (default: `"JSONRPC"`)
- `protocolVersion`: `"1.0"`

### 2.3 Tool-to-Skill Mapping

Each Chio `ToolDefinition` from registered manifests becomes one A2A
skill entry. The mapping rules are:

| Chio Field | A2A Skill Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tool.name` | `id`, `name` | Skill ID matches the Chio tool name |
| `tool.description` | `description` | Passed through unchanged |
| (inferred) | `tags` | Empty by default; MAY be populated by operators |
| (fixed) | `inputModes` | `["text"]` |
| (fixed) | `outputModes` | `["text"]` |
| `tool.has_side_effects` | `bridgeFidelity` | Used as fidelity signal |

When multiple manifests contain tools with the same name, the edge MUST NOT
silently collapse them. Unqualified ambiguous names are withheld from the
authoritative surface, and only deterministic qualified identifiers are
published.

### 2.4 SendMessage and SendStreamingMessage

#### 2.4.1 SendMessage (Blocking)

The edge handles `message/send` JSON-RPC requests by:

1. Resolving the target skill ID from `params.metadata.arc.targetSkillId`.
   If only one skill is registered, the edge MAY infer the target
   automatically.
2. If multiple skills are registered and no `targetSkillId` is provided,
   the edge MUST return a JSON-RPC error (code `-32602`).
3. Extracting arguments from the message parts. If a `Data` part is
   present, it is used as the arguments object. Otherwise, `Text` parts
   are concatenated and wrapped as `{"message": "<text>"}`.
4. Invoking the tool through the `ToolServerConnection`.
5. Returning a `TaskResponse` with a unique task ID.

The task response MUST include:

- `id`: a monotonically increasing task identifier (format: `a2a-task-{n}`)
- `status`: `completed` on success; `failed` on tool server error
- `message`: present when status is `completed`; contains the tool result
  converted to A2A message parts
- `statusMessage`: present when status is `failed`; contains the error
  description

#### 2.4.2 SendStreamingMessage

The authoritative A2A surface exposes `message/stream` as a deferred
receipt-bearing task lifecycle rather than a push-stream transport.

`message/stream` MUST:

1. Resolve the target skill using the same rules as `message/send`.
2. Create a working `TaskResponse` with signed-authority metadata and
   `receiptPending = true`.
3. Persist the deferred execution request under the returned task ID.
4. Require follow-up `task/get` or `task/cancel` calls to resolve or cancel
   the task.

#### 2.4.3 GetTask / CancelTask

The authoritative A2A surface also exposes:

| Method | Purpose | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `task/get` | Resolve a deferred `message/stream` task | `TaskResponse` |
| `task/cancel` | Cancel a deferred `message/stream` task before execution | `TaskResponse` |

`task/get` MUST execute the deferred request through the authoritative Chio
path the first time it is called for a working task and then persist the
terminal result. Terminal task results MUST carry the same signed Chio receipt
metadata as `message/send`.

#### 2.4.4 Result Conversion

Tool results are converted to A2A message parts using these rules:

| Result Type | A2A Part Type | Conversion |
|---|---|---|
| String value | `text` | Used directly |
| Object with `content` array | `text` (per entry) | Each `content[].text` becomes a text part |
| Other object or array | `data` | Passed through as structured data |
| Other scalar | `text` | Converted via `to_string()` |

### 2.5 BridgeFidelity Evaluation

The edge evaluates fidelity per tool at registration time. The assessment
indicates how faithfully an Chio tool maps to A2A semantics.

| Fidelity Level | Criteria | Implications |
|---|---|---|
| `lossless` | Tool is publishable and does not depend on approval, deferred-stream, cancellation, or partial-output caveats | The current A2A edge can project the tool without semantic loss |
| `adapted` | Tool is publishable but side-effect, deferred-stream, cancellation, or partial-output semantics require explicit caveats | The edge preserves the tool through A2A but must surface caveats in discovery metadata |
| `unsupported` | Tool requires interactive approval or explicit publication suppression (`x-chio-publish: false`) | The tool MUST NOT be auto-published on the A2A surface |

The `bridgeFidelity` field is included in each skill entry in the Agent
Card. Clients SHOULD use this field to assess whether the A2A interface
is sufficient for their use case. `Unsupported` skills are withheld from the
Agent Card entirely.

The current implementation uses these semantic hints when present on the tool
schema:

- `x-chio-publish`
- `x-chio-approval-required`
- `x-chio-streaming`
- `x-chio-cancellation`
- `x-chio-partial-output`

### 2.6 Kernel-Mediated Receipts

Every `SendMessage` invocation that reaches the tool server MUST flow
through the kernel guard pipeline. The resulting signed receipt includes:

- `tool_name`: the Chio tool name (matching the A2A skill ID)
- `server_id`: the server ID from the manifest that owns the tool
- `decision`: `allow` for completed tasks; `deny` for guard rejections

When the tool server returns an error, the task status is `failed` but a
receipt is still generated with the `deny` or `incomplete` decision as
appropriate.

## 3. ACP Edge (`chio-acp-edge`)

### 3.1 Overview

The ACP edge exposes Chio kernel-governed tools as ACP (Agent Client
Protocol) capabilities. This allows ACP-compatible editors and IDEs to
access Chio-governed tools through the ACP permission model.

ACP has a narrow tool model organized around four categories: filesystem,
terminal, browser, and generic tool. The edge maps Chio tools into this
model with category inference and fidelity assessment.

### 3.2 Chio Tools as ACP Capabilities

Each Chio `ToolDefinition` becomes one ACP capability advertisement. The
mapping rules are:

| Chio Field | ACP Capability Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tool.name` | `id`, `name` | Capability ID matches the Chio tool name |
| `tool.description` | `description` | Passed through unchanged |
| (inferred) | `category` | See Section 3.3 |
| `tool.has_side_effects` + config | `requiresPermission` | `true` if config requires permission OR tool has side effects |
| (evaluated) | `bridgeFidelity` | See Section 3.5 |

When multiple manifests contain tools with the same name, the edge MUST NOT
silently collapse them. Unqualified ambiguous names are withheld from the
authoritative surface, and only deterministic qualified identifiers are
published.

### 3.3 Category Inference

The edge infers the ACP category from the tool name using keyword
matching. The inference rules, applied in order:

| Pattern | Category | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Name contains `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_dir`, or starts with `fs_` | `filesystem` | `read_file`, `fs_stat`, `write_file` |
| Name contains `terminal`, `exec`, `shell`, or `command` | `terminal` | `exec_command`, `run_shell` |
| Name contains `browser`, `navigate`, or `screenshot` | `browser` | `browser_click`, `take_screenshot` |
| No match | `tool` (configurable default) | `search`, `get_weather` |

When no pattern matches, the edge MUST fall back to
`AcpEdgeConfig.default_category`, which defaults to `tool`.

### 3.4 Permission Evaluation

The edge implements fail-closed permission evaluation backed by Chio
capabilities.

The edge handles `session/request_permission` JSON-RPC requests by:

1. Looking up the capability by ID. If the capability is unknown, the
   edge MUST return `deny`.
2. If `requiresPermission` is `true` for the capability, the edge MUST
   return `deny` by default. Explicit permission grants require kernel
   capability token validation (full integration deferred to Phase 324).
3. If `requiresPermission` is `false`, the edge MUST return `allow`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as IDE / ACP Client
    participant E as ACP Edge
    participant K as Chio Kernel

    I->>E: session/request_permission(capabilityId, arguments)
    E->>E: Lookup capability
    alt Unknown capability
        E-->>I: deny
    else Known capability
        E->>K: Validate capability token
        K->>K: Evaluate guards (fail-closed)
        alt Permission required and not granted
            K-->>E: Deny
            E-->>I: deny
        else Permission not required or granted
            K-->>E: Allow
            E-->>I: allow
        end
    end
```

### 3.5 BridgeFidelity Assessment

The edge evaluates fidelity based on both the inferred ACP category and
tool properties.

| Fidelity Level | Criteria | Implications |
|---|---|---|
| `lossless` | Category is `filesystem` or `terminal` and no caveated semantic hints are present | ACP natively supports the projection without caveats |
| `adapted` | Capability is publishable but depends on permission-preview, collected streaming, partial-output, cancellation, or generic-tool-category caveats | The capability remains discoverable but caveats MUST be surfaced in `bridgeFidelity` |
| `unsupported` | Category is `browser`, category is generic mutating `tool`, or publication is disabled with `x-chio-publish: false` | The capability MUST NOT be auto-published on the ACP surface |

The `bridgeFidelity` field is included in each capability advertisement.
Clients SHOULD use this field to determine whether the ACP interface
provides sufficient fidelity for their use case. `Unsupported` capabilities are
withheld from `session/list_capabilities`.

### 3.6 JSON-RPC Interface

The ACP edge exposes six JSON-RPC methods:

| Method | Purpose | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `session/list_capabilities` | List all ACP capabilities | `{ capabilities: [...] }` |
| `session/request_permission` | Evaluate permission for a capability | `{ decision: "allow" \| "deny" }` |
| `tool/invoke` | Invoke a capability through the kernel | Invocation result or error |
| `tool/stream` | Create a deferred authoritative invocation task | `{ task: {...} }` |
| `tool/cancel` | Cancel a deferred invocation task before execution | `{ task: {...} }` |
| `tool/resume` | Resolve a deferred invocation task through the kernel | `{ task: {...}, result: {...} }` |

Unknown methods MUST return a JSON-RPC error with code `-32601`.

### 3.7 Invocation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as IDE / ACP Client
    participant E as ACP Edge
    participant K as Chio Kernel
    participant T as Tool Server

    I->>E: tool/invoke(capabilityId, arguments)
    E->>E: Resolve capability binding
    E->>K: Validate capability + run guard pipeline
    alt Guard denies
        K-->>E: Deny verdict
        E-->>I: { success: false, error: "access denied" }
    else Guard allows
        K-->>E: Allow verdict
        E->>T: Invoke tool
        T-->>E: Tool result
        E->>K: Sign receipt
        K-->>E: Signed Chio receipt
        E-->>I: { success: true, data: result }
    end
```

Every authoritative invocation that reaches the tool server MUST produce a
signed receipt. Failed invocations (tool server errors) MUST return
`{ success: false, error: "<message>" }` and still produce a receipt. Deferred
tasks created through `tool/stream` remain receipt-pending until `tool/resume`
resolves them or `tool/cancel` marks them cancelled before execution.

---

## 4. OpenAI Adapter (`chio-openai`)

### 4.1 Overview

The OpenAI adapter intercepts OpenAI-style `tool_use` / function-calling
requests and routes them through the Chio kernel for capability validation
and receipt signing. It supports both the Chat Completions API format and
the Responses API format.

Every function call produces a signed receipt. Guards fail closed by
default.

### 4.2 Function Definition Generation

The adapter generates OpenAI-compatible tool definitions from Chio
`ToolManifest` entries. Each `ToolDefinition` becomes one OpenAI function:

| Chio Field | OpenAI Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tool.name` | `function.name` | Used directly; MUST match the receipt `tool_name` |
| `tool.description` | `function.description` | Passed through unchanged |
| `tool.input_schema` | `function.parameters` | JSON Schema for function parameters |

The adapter generates the `tools` array in the format expected by the
Chat Completions API:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "description": "Get the weather for a location",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### 4.3 Invocation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LLM as LLM (OpenAI API)
    participant A as OpenAI Adapter
    participant K as Chio Kernel
    participant T as Tool Server

    LLM->>A: tool_calls[{id, function: {name, arguments}}]
    A->>A: Parse function name and arguments
    A->>A: Resolve function binding
    alt Function not found
        A-->>LLM: ToolCallResult(denied: true, "function not found")
    else Arguments invalid
        A-->>LLM: ToolCallResult(denied: true, "parse error")
    else Valid call
        A->>K: evaluate_tool_call_blocking(ToolCallRequest)
        K->>K: Validate capability + run guard pipeline
        K->>T: Invoke tool when allowed
        T-->>K: Tool result or error
        K-->>A: ToolCallResponse with signed ChioReceipt
        A-->>LLM: ToolCallResult(content, denied, receipt_ref, receipt)
    end
```

### 4.4 Chat Completions API Support

The adapter processes tool calls from Chat Completions API responses. The
extraction flow:

1. The LLM response message contains a `tool_calls` array.
2. `extract_tool_calls()` deserializes each entry into an
   `OpenAiToolCall` struct.
3. Each tool call is executed via `execute_tool_call()`.
4. Results are converted to `role: "tool"` messages via
   `results_to_messages()` for inclusion in the next Chat Completions
   request.

The result message format:

```json
{
  "role": "tool",
  "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
  "content": "<serialized result>"
}
```

### 4.5 Responses API Support

The adapter also supports the OpenAI Responses API format. The
extraction flow:

1. The response contains an `output` array with items typed as
   `"function_call"`.
2. `extract_responses_api_calls()` filters for `function_call` items and
   extracts `name`, `arguments`, and `call_id`.
3. Each call is executed through the same `execute_tool_call()` path.
4. Results are converted to `function_call_output` items via
   `results_to_responses_api()`.

The output format:

```json
{
  "type": "function_call_output",
  "call_id": "fc_123",
  "output": "<serialized result>"
}
```

### 4.6 Receipt Generation

Every function call MUST produce a signed receipt. The receipt MUST
include:

- `tool_name`: the OpenAI function name, which matches the Chio tool name
- `server_id`: the adapter's configured server ID
- `receipt_ref`: the signed receipt's real `id`, included in the
  `ToolCallResult`
- `receipt`: the signed `ChioReceipt` object itself when the call reached
  the kernel

Receipt generation occurs for both successful and failed invocations:

| Outcome | `denied` | `receipt_ref` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Successful invocation | `false` | Present | Kernel returns signed receipt with allow verdict |
| Guard denial | `true` | Present | Kernel returns signed denial receipt |
| Tool server error | `true` | Present | Kernel returns signed denial receipt |
| Function not found | `true` | Absent | No kernel interaction occurred |
| Argument parse failure | `true` | Absent | No kernel interaction occurred |

When `receipt_ref` is absent, no kernel interaction occurred and
therefore no signed receipt was produced. The adapter MUST still mark
these calls as `denied: true`.

### 4.7 Batch Execution

The adapter supports executing multiple tool calls in a single batch via
`execute_tool_calls()`. This is the common case when an LLM issues
parallel function calls.

Batch execution MUST:

- Process each tool call sequentially in the provided order.
- Return the kernel-issued `receipt.id` as `receipt_ref` for each call that
  reaches the kernel.
- Return one `ToolCallResult` per input `OpenAiToolCall`.

Each call in the batch is independent. A failure in one call MUST NOT
prevent execution of subsequent calls. The caller receives the full
results array and can inspect each entry's `denied` field individually.

---

## 5. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 5.1 BridgeFidelity Summary

All edges use a three-level fidelity assessment:

| Level | Meaning | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| `lossless` | The Chio tool maps cleanly to the target protocol's native primitives | No caveats are required and the bridge may publish by default |
| `adapted` | The Chio tool is publishable only with explicit caveats | Discovery metadata MUST surface the caveats honestly |
| `unsupported` | The target protocol cannot represent the required semantics honestly | The tool MUST remain unpublished on that surface |

### 5.2 Fail-Closed Invariant

All bridges and edges MUST maintain the Chio fail-closed invariant:

- If the kernel is unreachable, requests MUST be denied.
- If a capability token is invalid or expired, requests MUST be denied.
- If guard evaluation produces an error, the request MUST be denied.
- Unknown tools, capabilities, or functions MUST be rejected before any
  upstream dispatch occurs.
- Unknown JSON-RPC methods MUST return error code `-32601`.

### 5.3 Receipt Chain Continuity

Signed receipts from bridged invocations MUST be compatible with the
core Chio receipt contract (PROTOCOL.md Section 6). Specifically:

- Receipts use the same `chio.receipt.v1` schema.
- Receipts are included in the same Merkle-committed receipt log.
- Receipts from bridged invocations are indistinguishable from native
  Chio receipts to downstream consumers (trust-control, evidence export,
  federation).

This ensures that auditors and operators see a unified evidence trail
regardless of the protocol surface that originated the invocation.
