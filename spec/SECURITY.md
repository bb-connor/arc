# ARC Security And Threat Model

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Status:** Normative shipped surface

This document defines the standalone threat model for the ARC agent-kernel-tool
trust boundary. It complements [WIRE_PROTOCOL.md](WIRE_PROTOCOL.md): that
document defines message shapes and lifecycle flows; this document defines the
attacks those flows must resist and the minimum transport security posture
required for safe deployment.

The keywords **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are normative in this document.

## 1. Boundary

ARC's security boundary for this document is the path from one caller with
authority material to one mediated tool execution:

1. capability issuance or continuation on the trust-control surface
2. hosted or native delivery of that authority to the kernel
3. kernel admission and policy evaluation
4. transport from the kernel to the selected tool server
5. receipt generation and return

Out of scope:

- broader wallet, passport, and web3 settlement profiles except where they
  directly change sender constraint or delegation semantics at this boundary
- host OS hardening details beyond the transport and process-isolation
  requirements stated here

Primary assets protected by this boundary:

- capability tokens and delegation state
- session identifiers and sender-binding context
- kernel authenticity
- tool-server execution confinement
- receipt integrity and policy verdict provenance
- availability of the mediated runtime

The machine-readable companion artifact for this document is:

- `spec/security/arc-threat-model.v1.json`

## 2. Threat Register

| `agent_velocity_abuse` | a single agent overwhelms the system by issuing requests across many capabilities faster than intended | all surfaces |
| `cumulative_data_exfiltration` | an attacker exfiltrates data through many small requests that individually appear benign | session data flow |

| `wasm_guard_resource_exhaustion` | a malicious or buggy WASM guard module consumes unbounded CPU or memory | WASM guard runtime |

### 2.1 Capability Token Theft

Attack:
an attacker captures a capability token, session artifact, or other authority
handle and attempts to reuse it from a different caller or at a later time.

Existing controls:

- capabilities are signed and time-bounded
- the kernel can require ARC-native DPoP per grant
- the hosted edge can enforce sender-constrained DPoP and mTLS thumbprint
  continuity
- revocation state exists for capability identifiers

Required mitigations:

- sensitive or cross-host flows **SHOULD** require sender constraint rather
  than rely on bearer-only capability use
- operators **SHOULD** pair capability lifetimes with the smallest feasible
  validity window
- deployments that scale across restart or failover **SHOULD** use durable or
  shared replay state for sender proofs

Residual risk:

- compatibility profiles still allow bearer-style capability use when DPoP or
  equivalent sender constraint is not required
- replay protection is weaker across restart or multi-node failover when proof
  nonce state is only process-local

### 2.2 Kernel Impersonation

Attack:
the caller establishes a session or native transport with a malicious service
that pretends to be the ARC kernel or hosted edge.

Existing controls:

- capabilities and receipts are signed artifacts rather than unsigned JSON
- version negotiation is explicit on the hosted edge and exact-match on the
  native lane
- production tool-server transport is modeled as authenticated transport rather
  than anonymous raw TCP

Required mitigations:

- any cross-host hosted MCP or trust-control deployment **MUST** use TLS
- any cross-host native deployment **MUST** use TLS and **MUST** authenticate
  the remote peer before authority is treated as valid
- operator distributions **SHOULD** pin or otherwise securely provision ARC
  verifier keys, service certificates, or equivalent trust anchors

Residual risk:

- plaintext local-development modes do not provide confidentiality or peer
  authenticity
- receipt verification still depends on the deployment's trust-anchor
  distribution discipline rather than one public transparency system

### 2.3 Tool Server Escape

Attack:
an admitted tool server process reads or mutates host state outside its
intended scope, or uses the kernel as a path to broader host compromise.

Existing controls:

- capability scope, tool name, and server id are mediated before invocation
- the kernel decides admission before any tool call reaches the server
- production tool-server transport is modeled as isolated transport rather than
  direct in-process mutation of kernel state

Required mitigations:

- tool servers **MUST** be treated as less trusted than the kernel unless they
  are part of the same reviewed binary and privilege domain
- cross-process or cross-host tool servers **MUST** run behind authenticated
  transport, and cross-host TCP **MUST** use mTLS
- operators **SHOULD** pair ARC mediation with OS or container confinement,
  least-privilege filesystem access, and outbound-network controls where the
  tool is not inherently trusted

Residual risk:

- ARC mediation cannot by itself sandbox arbitrary tool-server code
- a compromised tool process can still abuse whatever host privileges the
  operator granted it outside ARC

### 2.4 Native Channel Replay

Attack:
an attacker captures a native ARC frame or proof and replays it on the
length-prefixed channel to obtain duplicate or unauthorized execution.

Existing controls:

- the native lane is framed and typed, which limits parser ambiguity
- DPoP proofs can bind a request to capability id, tool target, action hash,
  sender key, freshness, and nonce uniqueness
- capabilities are time-bounded and can be revoked

Required mitigations:

- grants for replay-sensitive operations **SHOULD** require DPoP
- cross-host native traffic **MUST** use confidential authenticated transport
  so raw frames and proofs are not exposed on the network
- clustered or restart-tolerant deployments **SHOULD** avoid process-local-only
  nonce registries for high-value flows

Residual risk:

- the native framed lane has no independent in-band anti-replay marker outside
  the sender-proof and capability systems
- non-DPoP grants remain replayable within their validity window if the
  surrounding transport is exposed

### 2.5 Resource Exhaustion DoS

Attack:
an attacker attempts to consume memory, CPU, stream slots, or request capacity
to deny service to valid callers.

Existing controls:

- native frames larger than `16 MiB` are rejected
- hosted notification streams allow at most one active stream per session
- hosted sessions have explicit terminal states rather than silent resumption

Required mitigations:

- deployments **SHOULD** apply request-rate, concurrency, and time-budget
  limits at the hosted and trust-control edges
- operators **SHOULD** bound retained replay buffers, task queues, and
  per-session state
- high-value multi-tenant deployments **SHOULD** pair ARC with upstream load
  shedding and admission control

Residual risk:

- authenticated callers can still consume their own allowed budgets or queue
  share
- ARC's current size and lifecycle checks reduce but do not eliminate all
  asymmetric workload attacks

### 2.6 Delegation Chain Abuse

Attack:
an attacker attempts to widen scope during delegation, truncate lineage,
continue from the wrong parent, or exploit incomplete recursive validation.

Existing controls:

- trust-control delegated issuance already checks a signed delegation policy
  ceiling when one is supplied
- core helpers exist for delegation-chain validation and attenuation checks
- revocation state exists for capability identifiers

Required mitigations:

- delegated issuance **MUST NOT** exceed the signed delegation-policy ceiling
- runtime admission **SHOULD** resolve and validate complete parent lineage for
  high-trust delegated flows rather than trust presented metadata alone
- operators **SHOULD** revoke parent capabilities or delegation branches when
  downstream compromise is suspected

Residual risk:

- the current runtime boundary is stronger than unchecked delegation metadata
  but not yet a universally recursive, fail-closed delegated-authority proof
  system at every entry point
- revocation completeness is only as strong as the resolved lineage available
  to the runtime

### 2.7 SSRF via HTTP Substrate

Attack:
an agent crafts tool invocations that target internal network endpoints
(RFC 1918 addresses, loopback, link-local, cloud metadata, Kubernetes service
endpoints) through the HTTP substrate, bypassing network-level controls by
routing requests through a trusted tool server.

Existing controls:

- the InternalNetworkGuard blocks egress to private, reserved, loopback,
  link-local, cloud metadata, and Kubernetes addresses
- DNS rebinding detection catches hostnames embedding private IP patterns
- encoded IP detection blocks hex, decimal, and octal obfuscated addresses
- IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are resolved and checked against IPv4 rules

Required mitigations:

- deployments exposing HTTP substrate endpoints **MUST** enable the
  InternalNetworkGuard with DNS rebinding detection
- operators **SHOULD** add deployment-specific internal hostnames to the
  `extra_blocked_hosts` list
- the guard **MUST** fail closed on any address parse ambiguity

Residual risk:

- DNS time-of-check/time-of-use gaps remain: a hostname that resolves to a
  public address during guard evaluation may resolve to a private address
  when the tool server makes the actual request
- the guard operates on hostnames and IPs presented in tool arguments; it
  does not inspect redirects that occur during tool execution

### 2.8 PII/PHI Exposure in Responses

Attack:
a tool response contains personally identifiable information (PII) or
protected health information (PHI) such as SSNs, medical record numbers,
ICD-10 codes, email addresses, or credit card numbers, which the agent then
exfiltrates or includes in outputs visible to unauthorized parties.

Existing controls:

- the ResponseSanitizationGuard scans responses for PII/PHI patterns with
  configurable sensitivity levels and block/redact actions
- pre-invocation scanning prevents PII in request arguments from reaching
  tool servers
- custom patterns can be added for deployment-specific sensitive data

Required mitigations:

- deployments handling healthcare or financial data **MUST** enable the
  ResponseSanitizationGuard at `Medium` sensitivity or higher
- operators **SHOULD** configure `Redact` mode rather than `Block` where
  partial results are acceptable, to reduce information loss
- operators **SHOULD** define custom patterns for any deployment-specific
  identifiers (employee IDs, internal account numbers)

Residual risk:

- regex-based pattern detection is inherently incomplete; novel PII formats
  or obfuscated values (base64-encoded SSNs, split across fields) may evade
  detection
- the ICD-10 pattern may produce false positives on short alphanumeric strings
  in non-medical contexts
- image or binary content in tool responses is not scanned

### 2.9 Agent Velocity Abuse

Attack:
a single agent issues requests at a rate far exceeding intended usage, either
to exhaust system resources, race condition exploit time-sensitive operations,
or generate excessive billing across multiple capabilities.

Existing controls:

- the AgentVelocityGuard enforces per-agent and per-session rate limits using
  token-bucket semantics with configurable burst factors
- separate buckets per agent prevent one agent's exhaustion from affecting
  others
- separate buckets per session prevent cross-session token sharing

Required mitigations:

- multi-tenant deployments **MUST** configure per-agent rate limits
- operators **SHOULD** set per-session limits to bound the damage from a
  single compromised capability
- operators **SHOULD** set burst factors close to 1.0 for high-value
  operations to prevent burst abuse

Residual risk:

- rate limits are process-local; a multi-node deployment without shared state
  allows an agent to consume its full budget on each node
- an attacker controlling multiple agent identities can multiply the effective
  rate by the number of identities

### 2.10 Cumulative Data Exfiltration

Attack:
an attacker extracts sensitive data through many small, individually
innocuous requests that cumulatively transfer a large volume of data out of
the protected system. Each request appears benign to per-request guards.

Existing controls:

- the DataFlowGuard reads cumulative bytes-read and bytes-written totals
  from the session journal and denies requests when configured limits are
  exceeded
- the DataTransferAdvisoryGuard provides early warning signals before hard
  limits are hit
- the session journal tracks all data flow with saturating arithmetic to
  prevent overflow

Required mitigations:

- deployments with sensitive data stores **MUST** configure DataFlowGuard
  limits appropriate to their data classification
- operators **SHOULD** pair DataFlowGuard with DataTransferAdvisoryGuard
  promotion rules to detect gradual exfiltration before the hard limit
- operators **SHOULD** set `max_bytes_total` in addition to individual
  read/write limits to catch mixed-mode exfiltration

Residual risk:

- data flow accounting is per-session; an attacker that establishes many
  short sessions can circumvent per-session limits
- byte counts reflect content-length, not semantic information density;
  compressed data may carry more information than the byte count suggests
- denied requests still count toward cumulative totals; the session is
  effectively terminated once a limit is hit

### 2.11 Behavioral Sequence Attacks

Attack:
an attacker chains tool invocations in dangerous sequences that bypass
safety assumptions. Examples include executing arbitrary code and then
overwriting audit logs, writing to sensitive paths without first reading
the existing content, or repeating a destructive operation many times in
succession.

Existing controls:

- the BehavioralSequenceGuard enforces four types of ordering constraints:
  required predecessors, forbidden transitions, max consecutive invocations,
  and required first tool
- the session journal tracks the complete tool invocation sequence including
  denied invocations

Required mitigations:

- operators **SHOULD** define forbidden transitions for known dangerous
  sequences in their deployment (e.g., `bash` followed by `write_file`)
- operators **SHOULD** require initialization tools as the first tool in
  sessions that depend on setup state
- operators **SHOULD** set max consecutive limits to prevent infinite loops
  on destructive operations

Residual risk:

- the guard cannot prevent dangerous sequences that span multiple sessions
- forbidden transitions only check the immediately preceding tool; a
  dangerous pair separated by an innocent tool in between will not be caught
- the guard operates on tool names, not on the semantic content of the
  invocations

### 2.12 WASM Guard Resource Exhaustion

Attack:
a malicious or buggy WASM guard module enters an infinite loop, allocates
unbounded memory, or performs excessive computation, consuming host resources
and denying service to the kernel.

Existing controls:

- WASM guards execute under a fuel budget (default 10,000,000 units) that
  limits CPU consumption per invocation
- fuel exhaustion immediately terminates the guest and the invocation is
  treated as denied (fail-closed)
- WASM guards execute in isolated linear memory with no access to host
  filesystem, network, or kernel state
- no host callback functions are exposed to the guest

Required mitigations:

- operators **MUST** set fuel limits appropriate to the complexity of their
  custom guards; the default of 10,000,000 units is suitable for simple
  pattern-matching guards
- operators **SHOULD** test WASM guards in advisory mode before enabling
  them as blocking guards in production
- operators **SHOULD** monitor fuel consumption to detect guards that
  consistently approach their fuel limit

Residual risk:

- linear memory allocation within the fuel budget is bounded by the WASM
  runtime's memory limits but not explicitly capped by ARC; a guard that
  allocates large amounts of memory within its fuel budget may increase host
  memory pressure
- compilation of WASM modules is not fuel-metered; a pathologically complex
  module could consume significant CPU during compilation

## 3. Transport Security Requirements

Transport requirements are surface-specific. The matrix below defines the
minimum shipped rules.

| Surface | TLS requirement | mTLS requirement | DPoP requirement | When transport security is absent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native ARC direct transport | **MUST** use TLS for any cross-host or untrusted-network deployment. Same-host UDS or loopback development **MAY** omit TLS. | **MUST** use mTLS when the remote peer identity is itself part of the authorization trust decision or when operators cross an untrusted boundary. | **MUST** use DPoP whenever the matched grant requires it. | Only same-host UDS or loopback development is conformant. Otherwise the deployment is nonconformant and capability/session material is considered exposed. |
| Hosted MCP HTTP (`/mcp`) | **MUST** use TLS for any remote or non-loopback deployment. Plain HTTP is only for loopback or explicit test harnesses. | **MUST** use mTLS when the active sender-constrained session profile binds to an mTLS thumbprint. Otherwise mTLS is optional, not universal. | **MUST** use DPoP when the active sender-constrained profile or downstream matched grant requires it. Missing required proof is a denial, not a downgrade. | Remote plaintext deployment is nonconformant. Session ids, proofs, and authority material are treated as observable and replayable. |
| Trust-control HTTP (`/v1/...`) | **MUST** use TLS for any remote or non-loopback deployment. Plain HTTP is only for local development and test harnesses. | **MUST** use mTLS for operator-internal service-to-service deployments that rely on transport identity rather than bearer auth alone. | DPoP is not the primary trust-control transport mechanism today. If sender-constrained issuance inputs are used, the receiving profile **MUST** preserve their required proof semantics downstream. | Remote plaintext deployment is nonconformant and downgrades issuance, revocation, and receipt-query confidentiality and authenticity to local-dev-only posture. |
| Kernel-to-tool transport | Same-host UDS **SHOULD** be preferred. If TCP or another network transport is used, TLS is implicit in the mTLS requirement. | Cross-host or cross-process TCP transport **MUST** use mTLS. Same-host UDS does not need mTLS because the OS path is the authenticated boundary. | DPoP does not replace kernel-to-tool transport authentication. Sender proof binds the caller to the capability, not the tool server to the kernel. | Unauthenticated network transport is nonconformant for production. Tool identity and confidentiality are not established. |

Additional rules:

- Attestation alone never substitutes for sender proof. If a profile binds an
  attestation digest, it **MUST** still pair that with DPoP or mTLS continuity
  over the same request.
- A deployment **MUST NOT** claim production-grade impersonation resistance,
  confidentiality, or replay resistance when it intentionally operates on
  plaintext remote transports.
- If a required transport security property is missing, the implementation
  **MUST** deny the request or restrict the deployment to an explicitly local
  development posture.

## 4. Implementation Guidance

- Same-host development can rely on loopback or UDS transport, but that is a
  deployment carve-out, not a general weakening of the production rules.
- Cross-host deployments should treat sender constraint and transport
  authentication as complementary:
  transport authentication proves the service identity; DPoP proves caller
  possession of the sender-bound key.
- Tool servers are not made safe by transport security alone. ARC mediation
  protects admission and auditability, but host-level sandboxing remains the
  operator's responsibility.

## 5. Machine-Readable Register

`spec/security/arc-threat-model.v1.json` is the normative machine-readable
representation of:

- the minimum threat set
- the mitigation and residual-risk mapping for each threat
- the transport requirements per surface

Implementations and future standards work **SHOULD** treat that artifact as the
stable registry for phase `313`.
